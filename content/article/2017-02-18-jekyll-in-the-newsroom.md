It’s all about Jekyll and journalism: Find out how ProPublica uses Jekyll and Grunt to report some of its biggest stories, including everything from helping a network of over 1,000 journalists cover Election Day in real time (on the site "Electionland"), to telling the sordid tale of how a U.S. company helped aid a notorious warlord—and everything in between.

About David Sleight:

David became ProPublica’s first design director in May of 2014, where he oversees editorial design and production.

He has also led the interactive design team at BusinessWeek.com, and helped build some of the first web-based textbooks at Pearson Education.
