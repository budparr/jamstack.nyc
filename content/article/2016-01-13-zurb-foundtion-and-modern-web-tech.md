Geoff Kimball from ZURB, a main architect behind Foundation 6, a popular CSS framework, presents and explains how Foundation 6 uses their new static site generator Panini as a central build tool.

Panini is a custom built, light-weight static site generator that works as a plugin to gulp. ZURB migrated from the grunt based assemble, to Panini, when launching Foundation 6.
