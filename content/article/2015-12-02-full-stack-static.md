#### Joint Meetup! "static is the New Dynamic" with the "NY Web Performance" Meetup.

_Updated with video and slides_

We'll be hosted by Workmarket who will be providing free pizza and beer! This talk centers around making static sites work in the real world; from editing content (for non-technical users), to building and staging sites, to deployment and hosting, as well as user interaction. We'll review the landscape of tools and real-world use-cases.

For newcomers to the world of static we'll start with a brief introduction and some points of reference. We'll be joined by Jeremia Kimelman of the U.S. General Services Administration's 18F group [https://18f.gsa.gov/] to talk about why and how they're enabling government agencies to publish static websites using existing tools along with a demo of their new open source "Federalist" platform.
