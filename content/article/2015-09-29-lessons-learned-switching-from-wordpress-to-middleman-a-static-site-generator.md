> Description: Middleman is perhaps the most used static site generator when it comes to large enterprise sites. James Stone, is a blogger, evangelist for Foundation and ZURB, and before everything else a developer. He’s giving a talk on his experience coming from Wordpress to Middleman. He will try and shed some light on how it’s become the favourite site maker for some of the World’s top agencies and why it’s been chosen to build sites such as Mailchimp, Nest, Smartcoin, etc.
