Thomas Reynolds is the Technical Director at famed Portland digital agency Instrument.

Heâ€™s also the creator of Middleman, one of the most used static site generators for large enterprise sites like MailChimp, Sequoia Capitol and Vox Media.

That's why we're flying him to San Francisco to talk to you about the newest, largely re-written version of his creation, the static site generator Middleman!

Come gather with like-minded SF Static Web Techies--and bring your friends--for free food, drinks and insightful conversation about how the New Stack is changing the face of the internet.

Netlify & Wikia organize and sponsor this session of the SF Static Web Tech meetup.
