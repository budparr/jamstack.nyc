Last month we took a dive into javascript and APIs, so this month, in collaboration with the Hacker Hours Meetup, let's spend some time working with one of the most popular static site generators around, Jekyll.

“Getting Going with Jekyll” is a beginner to intermediate workshop on building a website using the Jekyll static site generator. Not just for blogs, Jekyll is adept at handling a wide variety of projects from simple to complex. Jekyll enjoys a wide and avid user base and a large ecosystem.

We'll talk about the quickest way to start a new project, the best approach to structuring a project, essential plugins, and some tips on doing some pretty cool things with Jekyll.

If you want to follow along on your own, try to have Jekyll installed on your computer and have a Github account.

Topics may include (send me feedback if you want to cover something else):

* Getting up and running

* choosing content types (pages, collections, posts).

* Helpful configuration options

* Essential plugins

* Creating relationships between content

* Creating events.
