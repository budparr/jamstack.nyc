Scott Gallant, co-founder of [Forestry.io](https://forestry.io/) will talk about the CMS he's creating for Jekyll and Hugo static site generators.

The fact that Forestry.io works on Hugo as well as Jekyll sites is a huge step forward for all of us, and I urge you to attend to see what Scott's up to and give feedback to help make the product the best it can be at this early stage.

We will begin the Meetup with a short presentation called "Convince your Boss/Client" about why site owners should consider static web tech.
