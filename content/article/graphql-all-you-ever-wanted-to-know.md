### **Presenter Biographies**

Mark and Andrew are the Co-founders of [TakeShpe](https://www.takeshape.io/). They met 15 years ago in the Computer Science department at Northeastern University. And they were on the engineering teams behind big content sites like Newsweek, The Daily Beast, and Fast Company magazines.  
Andrew

Andrew started his career in enterprise search and natural language processing at Autonomy, acquired by HP. After that, he moved into media where he led the engineering team at Newsweek and The Daily Beast. Prior to TakeShape he was CTO and Co-Founder of a startup called Fairtread where he helped creators monetize their digital content.

Mark: For the past 7 years, Mark was the managing director of Ronik, an award-winning creative agency in Brooklyn. He’s had to solve content management conundrums for clients, building everything from traditional media sites to interactive experiences and marketing platforms.

Together Andrew and Mark have directly experienced just about every problem you can encounter with content management and they’ve been obsessed with finding better ways to deliver and render content on the web.
