# Code of Conduct

These policies apply to all the New Dynamic/JAMstack.NYC “spaces”, which include: events, the Meetup group, the mailing list, the Slack community, and all other forms of communication related to the group. **If someone is violating any of these policies or you feel uncomfortable in the group in any way, please let one of the organizers know.**

## [#](#general)General

- Anyone is welcome, and everyone should _feel_ welcome.
- Be respectful of one another. This is a small community and there is no room for jerks.
- Our community includes people who work at vendors as well consumers of their products. Vendors, you are welcome to promote your products, but if you do, please be active members of our community and do not merely promote your product.
- Likewise, vendors are not here merely for support. Questions of a support nature can be posted, but please do not reach out to members directly, expecting support.
- Approach your interactions with thoughtfulness and care. Recognize the myriad differences between yourself and others, and that you may not view the world through the same lens. Do not dismiss someone because they have a different level of experience, are of a different background, or have a difference of opinion. Be kind to others.
- D not presume anything you say here will remain private, so act accordingly. Protect IP and legally-protected information.

## [#](#code-of-conduct)Code of Conduct

the New Dynamic/JAMstack.NYC is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, both online and off. We do not tolerate harassment in any form. No weapons or illegal drugs of any kind are allowed at our events. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled at the discretion of the organizers.

#### [#](#harassment-includes)Harassment includes:

- Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, age, race, or religion (or lack thereof).
- Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment.
- Deliberately calling someone a name or pronoun after being corrected.
- Sexual images or behavior.
- Any deliberate intimidation, threat, or incitement of violence.
- Publication of non-harassing private communication.

Additionally, in physical spaces:

- Physical contact (such as a hug or backrub) or simulated physical contact without consent.
- Stalking or following.
- Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes.
- Sustained disruption of discussion.
- Unwelcome sexual/romantic attention.
- Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others.
- Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease.
- Deliberate “outing” of any aspect of a person’s identity without their consent, except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse.

We prioritize marginalized people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort and therefore we will not act on complaints regarding:

- ‘Reverse’ -isms, including ‘reverse racism,’ ‘reverse sexism,’ and ‘cisphobia’.
- Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as “leave me alone,” “go away,” or “I’m not discussing this with you”.
- Criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions.
