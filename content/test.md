# Executive Summary

This Report is designed to recommend options that can be implemented by Congress and the Executive Branch following the 2020 elections for pragmatic engagement between the U.S. Government and the International Criminal Court.

The United States has long been a supporter of international justice efforts, including the effort to create a permanent International Criminal Court (ICC). It has repeatedly expressed—in legislation, Presidential directives, military manuals, strategic messaging, and elsewhere—its strong national interests in accountability, compliance with international humanitarian and human rights law, prevention of mass atrocities, and the rule of law. The deep, bipartisan commitment to these values is reflected in the United States’ long history of supporting tribunals to ensure accountability for those that commit atrocity crimes– from its instrumental role in establishing of the Nuremberg and Tokyo tribunals to try major war criminals after World War II, to its critical support for the International Criminal Tribunals for Rwanda and the Former Yugoslavia and its ongoing support to a wide range of other international, hybrid and domestic initiatives (as the Report recounts briefly in Section I).

In light of this history, the United States played a significant role in the negotiation of the Rome Statute, and subsequently in the ICC’s Elements of Crimes and Rules of Procedure and Evidence (which contain many features proposed by U.S. negotiators). While U.S. legal and policy objections to certain key aspects of the Rome Statute have been present since the treaty’s negotiation in 1998, U.S. policy toward the Court has evolved over time, depending on a range of factors both within and without the U.S. government. And though there have been periods of significant tension, the United States has on numerous occasions and in numerous ways provided a wide range of support to the ICC in key investigations and cases (as the Report explores in Section III).

In 2009, as the Obama Administration was taking office, an earlier Task Force —convened by the American Society of International Law and chaired by William H. Taft IV and Judge Patricia M. Wald—produced an invaluable report examining U.S. policy toward the ICC and making recommendations to assist the then-incoming Obama Administration in developing its policy toward the Court. Although the Bush Administration had initially been hostile toward the Court, the Task Force’s central recommendation was that the new Administration should build upon the greater engagement with the Court that had taken root in the latter part of the Bush Administration. Many of the report’s concrete suggestions were ultimately reflected in the Obama Administration’s eventual case-by-case policy under which the United States engaged with Rome Statute parties on issues of mutual concern and provided support for the ICC’s investigation and prosecution of those cases that advanced U.S. interests and values, consistent with the requirements of U.S. law and the commitment to protect U.S. personnel.

Much has changed since the 2009 report, however. By the end of the Obama Administration, the prospect of formal investigations by the ICC Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) in the situations in Afghanistan and Palestine was increasingly placing a strain on this approach. Thereafter, the election of President Trump in 2016 heralded a fundamentally adversarial relationship between the United States and the Court. And while much of the Court’s work continues to align well with U.S. interests, the steps to commence investigations in Afghanistan and Palestine have dominated the relationship in the past few years. This deterioration in relations culminated the Trump Administration’s determination that the ICC’s work constituted an “unusual and extraordinary threat” to national security and its decision to impose economic sanctions and visa restrictions on senior ICC officials, including the Chief Prosecutor herself– steps which were widely criticized and led many states (including close U.S. allies) to distance themselves from the U.S. position and to reaffirm their support for the Court.

Meanwhile, the Court appears to have reached a crossroads of its own, with many of its traditional supporters increasingly expressing concerns about the Court’s output, working methods, and strategic direction. Indeed, in April 2019, the four former Presidents of the ICC Assembly of States Parties (ASP) published a highly critical letter reflecting their disappointment with the Court’s performance, stating that it was time to “make a new deal between the ICC and its states parties” and calling for “an independent assessment of the Court’s functioning.” The ICC states parties subsequently launched a process of review and reform that included the appointment of a group of nine eminent experts, chaired by Justice Richard Goldstone of South Africa, to conduct an “Independent Expert Review.” Following wide-ranging consultations, the Independent Experts issued an extensive report in September 2020 containing searching critiques of how the Court has functioned and putting forward 384 recommendations aimed at states parties and the organs of the Court.

Importantly, many of the critiques that are driving the ICC review and reform process align with U.S. concerns, including that the Court has over-extended itself and needs to find ways to better focus its efforts on situations and cases in which it can more effectively advance justice. The implementation of those recommendations forms part of a wider process in which states parties are pursuing changes within the Court to refocus its efforts, including exploring ways for the Assembly of States Parties to play a more active role in oversight and discussions to review the principle of complementarity. These moves for reform also coincide with the election of a new Prosecutor, Karim Khan, a British barrister with extensive experience in international prosecutions who currently serves as Special Adviser and Head of the UN Investigative Team to Promote Accountability for Crimes Committed by Da’esh/ISIL (UNITAD) - to take office in June 2021.

The Task Force has thus undertaken its efforts in a context fundamentally different than that faced by its predecessor in 2009. In the course of the Task Force’s consultations, several interlocutors questioned whether—given the emergence of trenchant concerns about the Court’s performance, questions about its efficacy as an instrument for combating impunity and delivering justice, and the sense that the support of so many states parties has become lukewarm—working to find a better posture toward the Court warranted the expenditure of the political capital that would be required. Nonetheless, our consultations have indicated that the great majority of our friends and allies remain invested in trying to improve the Court’s performance. They thus view the hostility of the U.S. policy toward the Court over the last four years, including the imposition of sanctions and other efforts widely seen as aimed at the Court’s destruction, as emblematic of the prior administration’s excesses—a view shared by a range of U.S. stakeholders with whom we consulted.

At the same time, there is an unavoidable political reality that, whatever one’s views of the Court, the actions that the ICC takes in the situations in Afghanistan and Palestine will significantly affect any prospects for constructive engagement by the United States. Virtually every interlocutor with whom we spoke who has served, or was serving, in the U.S. Government underscored this point. For better or worse, the extent to which the United States is in a position to be supportive of ICC efforts will inevitably be influenced by developments in those two situations. Recommendations that fail to deal with this reality would not be viable, and the Task Force has thus sought to address these issues at considerable length in its recommendations in Section VI of this report.

While any recommendations on engagement must build and learn from the history of prior U.S. engagement with the Court, the Task Force believes firmly that the United States cannot simply revert to the approach recommended by the previous ASIL Task Force, or even to the policy as it existed by the end of the Obama Administration. Such an approach would not account for the significant challenges that the United States currently faces in its relationship with the Court. Nor would it take advantage of opportunities to address longstanding U.S. concerns presented by the unprecedented openness to constructive criticism and reform amongst states parties.

The Task Force is also conscious that U.S. commitment to atrocity prevention, accountability, human rights, and the rule of law extend far beyond the ICC. While the ICC looms large in discussions of international accountability, it can only ever be one piece of the global accountability puzzle. The United States has had, and should continue to have, a robust, effective policy toward global criminal justice that encompasses a variety of national, regional, and international justice mechanisms. As reflected in the Task Force’s recommendations, U.S. atrocities prevention and response policy should ensure that its relationship with the ICC does not overshadow or interfere with its pursuit of these global imperatives.

In addition, at the end of the day, U.S. policy toward the ICC is not developed in isolation but rather as part of its approach to international institutions and multilateral cooperation more generally. This strongly suggests that the new Administration will need to find a way to address ICC issues that fits with, and contributes to, its approach to this larger policy mosaic, and with its deep interest in maintaining a leading voice on issues of accountability, human rights and rule of law. It is the Task Force’s view that undifferentiated hostility toward the ICC will continue to entail significant diplomatic costs.

The report is organized as follows. Section I sets out basic background about the U.S. relationship with the ICC, situating the ways in which different administrations have engaged with the ICC in the wider context of the United States’ leading role in promoting accountability for international crimes prior to the formation of the Court and beyond. Section II sets out the operative legislative framework that governs U.S. relations with the ICC and how it has evolved over time.

Section III looks in more detail at the various ways in which the United States has engaged on ICC issues. As salient examples, the United States played a critical role in the surrender of two of the most important ICC fugitives over the last decade—Bosco Ntaganda, a rebel leader from the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo in 2013 and Dominic Ongwen, a senior commander of the Lord’s Resistance Army, which has terrorized northern Uganda and surrounding region for decades, in 2015. As another example, the United States’ decision enable the U.N. Security Council referring the situation in Darfur to the ICC, and its subsequent support for that investigation, is a reminder that that even strong concerns about the Court can easily be outweighed by even stronger concerns about the kind of atrocities that the creation of the Court was intended to combat. And as yet another example, the negotiations over the crime of aggression, leading up to and during the 2010 review conference in Kampala, Uganda, illustrate both the costs of disengagement by the United States, and what the United States can achieve when it participates constructively to protect its interests on issues it considers important.

Section IV explores recent developments that are particularly relevant in assessing the options for U.S. engagement with the ICC in the coming years, notably the steps taken by the ICC to commence investigations in the situations in Afghanistan (potentially encompassing allegations of torture by U.S. personnel) and in Palestine and the current moves to reform the Court. There is no question that movement by the Prosecutor or Court on these two situations countries has complicated the United States’ ability to address ICC issues, and this section thus sets the stage for a significant portion of the Task Force’s recommendations.

But the developments in Afghanistan and Palestine are not the only relevant considerations, and Section V endeavors to describe the very broad range of ways in which numerous elements of ICC policy intersect with other U.S. interests. This includes both areas in which the Court’s work potentially conflicts, and areas in which it potentially aligns, with U.S. interests. At the end of the day, the United States has a deep and bipartisan commitment to atrocities prevention and response, and to supporting accountability for those who commit atrocity crimes, as evidenced for example by the passage of the Elie Wiesel Genocide and Atrocities Prevention Act of 2018 and other legislation supporting transitional justice and accountability measures.

In light of all these considerations, Section VI sets out the Task Force’s recommendations for how the Biden Administration should engage with the ICC on a pragmatic basis moving forward. Given the range of interests and perspectives, and the inevitable reality that different forms of engagement may be more or less feasible at different points in time, the Task Force identified four categories of recommendations: (A) initial steps to “clear the air,” re-cast the tone, and reinforce the U.S. approach to multilateralism and its shared goals with the ICC; (B) steps that are constructive and consistent with U.S. interests regardless of concerns about the ICC; (C) approaches to the three most critical issues—Afghanistan, Palestine, and the opportunities presented by the ongoing ICC review and reform process (which the Task Force see as closely related); and finally (D) possibilities for support for ICC efforts in particular situation countries.

1. “_Clearing the Air” and Re-Casting the Tone_: Especially given that the U.S. relationship with the ICC does not exist in a vacuum, the Task Force believes it will be important for the new Administration to speak about the Court and its personnel in a manner that comports with its overall approach to multilateralism, international institutions, and working with friends and allies. U.S. attacks on the Court in recent years, and especially the imposition of sanctions on the ICC Prosecutor and one of her staff, came at significant cost to the U.S. reputation and to its ability to be an effective voice on issues of importance to it. They also created an environment in which states parties felt that the Court needed to be defended and were forced to distance themselves from the U.S. position. Furthermore, states that were otherwise critical of the Court’s performance found it more difficult to pursue legitimate reforms that would have been in the interests of the United States.

\[The Task Force believes that the revocation of Executive Order 13928 on DATE was an essential first step. / The Task Force therefore recommends that the United States revoke Executive Order 13928, and the economic sanctions that have been imposed against ICC personnel under it, and that it also reverse any visa restrictions that may been imposed under the policy against ICC personnel and communicate this (whether publicly or privately) to the Court or the officials impacted.\] In addition, the Administration should publicly and decisively disavow any impression that its goal is the dissolution of the Court: neither the actual termination of the Court’s existence, nor the United States being seen as favoring such an outcome, is in the United States’ interest. And the new Administration should also make clear that it will cease the vitriolic rhetoric that has marked the last four years, in particular avoiding unsubstantiated _ad hominem_ allegations about corruption or bad faith.

2. _Steps that the U.S. Should Pursue Regardless of Specific Concerns About the ICC:_ There are also a number of steps that the Task Force believes that the United States should undertake, no matter what the state of its relationship with the ICC is, to promote its own independent interests in international justice and accountability and to present the United States’ position on the ICC and related activities. Such steps include:

* Enhancing the United States’ current support for international justice efforts, including by building accountability into the President’s National Security Strategy, maintaining the independence of the State Department’s Office of Global Criminal Justice and the position of Ambassador-at-Large, and assuring steady and predictable funding for other initiatives to provide accountability for atrocity crimes.
* Preserving political capital vis-à-vis references to the ICC by not withholding support for multilateral resolutions or declarations supporting international justice simply on the basis that those resolutions mention the ICC or insisting on the deletion of references to the ICC in resolutions that are devoted to issues that the United States cares about.
* Using existing U.S. authorities fully to target the perpetrators of atrocity crimes, including maintaining and expanding the War Crimes Rewards Program, supporting sanctions against those responsible for atrocity crimes, and implementing a no- or restricted-contacts policy.
* Strengthening the United States’ ability and commitment to prosecute international crimes domestically by enacting legislation to criminalize crimes against humanity and other atrocity crimes; directing the Department of Justice to endeavor to prosecute suspects within the United States for their substantive crimes rather than relying exclusively on immigration offences; and signaling that the United States will accept information and evidence from the ICC where this could assist in such prosecutions or in other enforcement actions.
* Reaffirming the U.S. commitment to support victims of international crimes and witnesses who are at risk because of their willingness to support accountability by continuing to support in-country assistance to victims of atrocity crimes, considering making a contribution to the Trust Fund for Victims, and continuing to offer protection to vulnerable witnesses.
* Attending and participating as an observer state in meetings of the Assembly of States Parties, and in other relevant meetings and conferences; actively following the substantive jurisprudence of the ICC, which at a minimum affects the ways in which allies interpret their legal obligations; and tasking diplomatic missions to report on relevant ICC developments and the views of host states on the Court. This information should be shared with Congress through regular reporting, including under the Elie Wiesel Act.

3. _Dealing with the biggest issues_: In considering how the United States should respond to the Court commencing an investigation in Afghanistan, it is important not to minimize or trivialize the nature of the abuses that occurred. At least some of the conduct of U.S. personnel at issue constituted torture and other war crimes under international law, and the fact that the Prosecutor or the Court has concluded that the perpetrators or architects of the policy should be investigated and held accountable does not mean that they are politically motivated. At the same time, it is equally clear that all prior administrations have strongly opposed an ICC investigation of these activities. However, given that U.S. arguments that the ICC cannot assert jurisdiction over the nationals of states, like the United States, that are not parties to the Rome Statute have proven consistently unpersuasive, the Administration needs to develop and articulate further reasons that the Court should not pursue investigations of U.S. persons in Afghanistan. This report presents a range of good-faith arguments with respect to the Court’s admissibility criteria that the United States can legitimately put forward to support its position that the ICC should not investigate or prosecute.

The situation in Afghanistan covers an enormous crime base including crimes by the Taliban, Afghan national forces, and other non-state armed groups that are far more extensive than the allegations against U.S. personnel. Instead of treating the Court as if actual cases against U.S. persons were underway or a _fait accompli_, the Report includes recommendations how the United States might make a persuasive case that the Court should not prioritize or expend resources on cases against U.S. personnel, building on opportunities presented by the current openness among Rome Statute parties and within the Court to constructive ideas for reform. As part of this, the United States should distinguish clearly the allegations of torture and other abuse that have been raised against DOD personnel and the allegations of such crimes in connection with the CIA’s enhanced interrogation program; and could include both more comprehensive explanations of the various investigations that it undertook (including the Durham investigation and others) as well as highlighting non-criminal responses that addressed allegations of mistreatment and put in place important measures to guard against repetition (including investigative commissions, legal and policy reforms, the withdrawal of controversial legal advice, civil suits, and other steps). The totality of these steps, together with the relative gravity of the abuses (compared with the scale of ongoing nature of crimes by the Taliban and other armed groups) provide a good faith basis to argue that the Prosecutor should not prioritize any investigation of or potential case against U.S. personnel.

While the investigation in Palestine raises different questions, and it is beyond the mandate of this Task Force to make recommendations for pragmatic options for Israeli engagement, the United States plainly has a keen interest in this situation. The Court’s recent conclusions that Palestine is a state for purposes of the Rome Statute, and that there is jurisdiction that extends to “Gaza and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem” are inconsistent with the longstanding U.S. views. That said, Israel has different interests to balance in how it deals with the ICC. Although the U.S. posture on the situation in Palestine will almost inevitably be more of a function of the direction of the Administration’s policy toward Middle East peace process issues than of its ICC policy, there are indications that an important Israeli goal has been to work toward persuading the ICC Prosecutor to de-prioritize these cases. To the extent that this is part of the Israeli strategy toward the Court, it would align with the general approach that the Task Force is recommending that the United States takes with respect to the Afghanistan situation, and could thereby offer opportunities to proceed in ways that are mutually supportive.

In this context, the United States should view the discussion of and momentum towards reform of the Court, which has developed independent of U.S. concerns or these two situations, as an opening to engage. These discussions are an opportunity to propose and implement changes that could both put the Court on firmer footing and reduce the prospect of future clashes between the ICC and the United States. In short, there is an opportunity to put forward credible arguments reflecting long-standing U.S. positions regarding the Court that may now find a more receptive audience and to do so in a manner that echoes the reasons that the United States believes pursuing an investigation of U.S. personnel in Afghanistan would be inappropriate.

In whatever approach that the United States takes to the situations of critical concern in its relations with the ICC, however, the Task Force urges that it keep perspective. The United States should be realistic about the true scale of any threat to U.S. personnel; avoid making the perfect the enemy of the good; and be open to different visions of “success” that include (for example) a prolonged period of inaction rather than insisting on a public assurance from the Prosecutor that he is not investigating or will not prosecute any U.S. personnel.

4. _Support for particular ICC cases_: Developments in the situations in Afghanistan and Palestine have dominated the discussion of the U.S. relationship with the ICC in recent years, and they are likely to continue to play a role in the extent to which the United States is willing to support the ICC in other cases in the future. However, the United States has provided a range of valuable support to other international criminal tribunals and has done so with the ICC in circumstances that are consistent with U.S. interests and law.

The Task Force believes that the new Administration should remain open to supporting the ICC in appropriate cases. The new Administration has already indicated that—while the bulk of its energies with respect to the ICC would be spent on “defending our personnel”—there may be “exceptional cases where we consider cooperating with the court as we sometime have in the past.” The Task Force recognizes that the political “space” for doing so will depend on wider circumstances, including most importantly the direction of ICC investigations or prosecutions in Afghanistan and Palestine. However, there remain a number of ICC investigations that are directly aligned with concrete U.S. interests and policy positions (_e.g._, in Myanmar, Georgia, Ukraine, and Darfur), and cases underway in situations in which the United States has already made significant investments in accountability and stability (_e.g._, in Northern Uganda, DRC, and CAR). In this regard, it would be advisable for the new Administration to give thought in advance to categories of situations in which it would make sense to be alert to the possibility of providing assistance.

1. Background

The United States boasts a tradition of leadership in promoting accountability for international crimes. The global movement to establish international judicial processes to help ensure that perpetrators are held to account and victims experience a sense of justice largely originated in the Nuremberg and Tokyo Tribunals. The United States was instrumental in the establishment of these institutions, which were created in large part due to the U.S. admonition that—in the famous words of Supreme Court Justice Robert H. Jackson—even those responsible for crimes “so calculated, so malignant and so devastating” as those committed by the Nazis “had the right to a fair trial on the facts and law” and should not (as some, including Winston Churchill, had suggested) be simply identified and summarily executed. U.S. lawyers played key roles in the prosecution of major war criminals before the tribunals, including Justice Jackson, who helped draft the Nuremberg Charter, shaped the charges, and served as U.S. Chief Prosecutor in the main trial of the major war criminals; Brigadier General Telford Taylor, who served as prosecutor in the _High Command_ Case and Chief Counsel following Jackson’s return to the United States; and Benjamin Ferencz, who served as chief prosecutor for the _Einsatzgruppen_ Case and remains a staunch advocate for international justice to this day. The eight “Nürnberg Principles,” which sought to encapsulate the Tribunal’s most important contributions to international law, serve to this day as an indelible testament to the precepts for which these great efforts have come to stand.

The United States also played a decisive role reviving international justice efforts after the Cold War. During the George H. W. Bush Administration, as unspeakable war crimes engulfed the former Yugoslavia, Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger called for “a second Nuremberg.” In the face of those atrocities, and the genocide that subsequently swept Rwanda in the spring of 1994, President Bill Clinton embraced the “obligation to carry forward the lessons of Nuremberg” as the reason that “we strongly support the United Nations War Crimes Tribunals for former Yugoslavia and Rwanda.” Following the creation of the two _ad hoc_ tribunals, the United States consistently backed these efforts prompting the first Prosecutor of both tribunals, Justice Richard Goldstone, to reflect that “neither \[the ICTY nor the ICTR\] would have been set up and neither of them would have got off the ground without the support from the United States.” This included diplomatic support in the U.N. Security Council and through intercessions with other states; financial support amounting to more than $1 billion over the life of the Tribunals; the issuance of rewards for information leading to the capture of fugitives; secondments of experienced lawyers from the Department of Justice and elsewhere; operational support in the form of assistance in the capture, detention, and transfer of fugitives, including essential contributions to the May 2020 arrest of long-time ICTR fugitive Félicien Kabuga; a steady stream of intelligence (notably including satellite imagery that identified the mass graves of victims of the Srebrenica massacre as well as forensic examination of ballistics evidence); and legal support, such as _amicus curiae_ briefs and the adoption of domestic legislation to facilitate the transfer of persons wanted by the tribunals, notwithstanding the absence of an extradition agreement.

U.S. support to global justice efforts has not been limited to these two tribunals. The United States has also provided substantial assistance to a range of other hybrid, regional, internationalized, and domestic mechanisms to ensure accountability to perpetrators and justice for victims of international crimes. This includes backing the establishment of, and helping to ensure adequate funding for, the Special Court for Sierra Leone (SCSL), the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC), the Special Tribunal for Lebanon (STL), the Kosovo Specialist Chambers, and the Extraordinary African Chambers, as well as specialized chambers, mobile courts, and dedicated investigative mechanisms at the international level (including the U.N. Investigative Team to Promote Accountability for Crimes Committed by Da’esh/ISIL (UNITAD); the International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism for Syria (IIIM); and the Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar (IIMM)) and domestically (including in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), the Central African Republic (CAR), and Guatemala). Many of these institutions benefited not only from strong institutional support from the United States but also from the contributions of U.S. lawyers and judges in key leadership positions.

When the international community turned its attention to creating a permanent international criminal court, the United States was an active participant in the negotiations during the Preparatory Committee meetings and the Diplomatic Conference that led to the adoption of the Rome Statute. Indeed, the Rome Statute—together with related instruments adopted in the aftermath of Rome—reflect pervasive U.S. contributions, including on the definitions of the three atrocity crimes (genocide, war crimes—in both international and non-international armed conflicts—and crimes against humanity), with which the United States expressed general satisfaction. However, the final jurisdictional provisions contained elements that were problematic for the United States, discussed at length in the 2009 report. With the inclusion of provisions allowing assertion of jurisdiction over nationals of states that were not parties to the Rome Statute, the United States faced the prospect of an international criminal tribunal with jurisdiction over its personnel, which brought competing U.S. interests to the fore. These and other U.S. concerns, which the previous ASIL Task Force considered in detail in its 2009 Report, prompted the United States to join six other nations in voting against adoption of the Statute at the conclusion of the Rome Conference. And while the Administration cited reservations about several of the provisions included in the final treaty text, it was the Court’s territorial jurisdiction that proved to be of the most acute and enduring. Thus, when asked at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing immediately following the Rome Conference about which flaw made it impossible for the United States to approve the treaty, the lead U.S. negotiator, Ambassador David Scheffer, pointed specifically to the provisions under which U.S. persons would be exposed to the Court’s jurisdiction.

Nonetheless, the United States ultimately signed the Rome Statute on December 31, 2000, the last day permitted. Even then, President Clinton underscored that “we are not abandoning our concerns about significant flaws in the treaty,” pointed “in particular” to its “claim \[of\] jurisdiction over personnel of states that have not” ratified the treaty, and said that he would not recommend its submission to the Senate for advice and consent “until our fundamental concerns have been satisfied.” This state of affairs did not end U.S. engagement with the Court, however. President Clinton also indicated that the point of signing the Rome Statute was to be in a position “to influence the evolution of the court.” In the period between the adoption of the text of the Statute and its entry into force in 2002, the United States participated constructively in the Preparatory Commission negotiations around the Rules of Procedure and Evidence and the Elements of Crimes. U.S. participation was critical in shaping these instruments—including in working to ensure that the elements of each crime were clearly delineated—and the United States joined consensus on the adoption of these key texts.

Subsequently, during the administration of President George W. Bush and as the Court came closer to becoming operational (the Rome Statute ultimately entered into force on July 1, 2002), the United States took a number of steps to distance and insulate itself from the Court, discussed in more detail below (see XXX). This included informing the U.N. Secretary General on May 6, 2002, that the United States did not intend to become a party to the ICC Statute (and thus incurred no obligations arising out of its earlier signature of the treaty); enacting the American Servicemembers’ Protection Act of 2002 (ASPA) and related statutory restrictions; concluding bilateral agreements obliging foreign states not to surrender U.S. persons to the ICC (so-called “Article 98 agreements”); and declining to participate in ICC fora, including the annual meetings of the Assembly of States Parties (ASP) as an observer or the Special Working Group on the Crime of Aggression. At the same time, the full views of the Bush Administration were set out in considerable length in a speech by then-Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Marc Grossman in May 2002. The speech underscored the United States’ opposition to the ICC, but reiterated the American belief in the imperatives of justice and accountability, particularly for the commission of grave crimes, and identified shared values with supporters of the Court. It also pledged broad support—political, financial, and logistical—for global justice and transitional justice efforts and indicated an intention to work with Congress to close gaps in U.S. law so that perpetrators would not evade justice in the United States (see text box).

\[_TEXT BOX_: _Under Secretary Grossman commenced his speech by identifying “Here’s what America believes in,” leading with_

* _“We believe in justice and the promotion of the rule of law._
* _We believe those who commit the most serious crimes of concern to the international community should be punished. …”_

_The speech went on to articulate the United States’ concerns with the ICC, including that it undermines the role of the U.N. Security Council in maintaining international peace and security (including by contemplating criminal prosecutions for the crime of aggression); is presided over by a Prosecutor who operates with insufficient checks and may succumb to politicized prosecutions; threatens U.S. sovereignty by being empowered to assert jurisdiction over the nationals of non-party states; complicates military cooperation given the extensive deployment of U.S. service members; and may improperly sit in judgment over sovereign decisions to engage in self-defense, use force in the face of a genocide, or address the commission of international crimes through non-penal means. However, it also articulated that:_

_“despite th\[ese\] difference\[s\], we must work together to promote real justice after July 1, when the Rome Statute enters into force. The existence of a functioning ICC will not cause the United States to retreat from its leadership role in the promotion of international justice and the rule of law. The United States will:_

* _Work together with countries to avoid any disruptions caused by the Treaty, particularly those complications in US military cooperation with friends and allies that are parties to the treaty._
* _Continue our longstanding role as an advocate for the principle that there must be accountability for war crimes and other serious violations of international humanitarian law._
* _Continue to play a leadership role to right these wrongs._
* _The armed forces of the United States will obey the law of war, while our international policies are and will remain completely consistent with these norms._
* _Continue to discipline our own when appropriate._
* _We will remain committed to promoting the rule of law and helping to bring violators of humanitarian law to justice, wherever the violations may occur._
* _We will support politically, financially, technically, and logistically any post-conflict state that seeks to credibly pursue domestic humanitarian law._
* _We will support creative ad-hoc mechanisms such as the hybrid process in Sierra Leone – where there is a division of labor between the sovereign state and the international community–as well as alternative justice mechanisms such as truth and reconciliation commissions._
* _We will work with Congress to obtain the necessary resources to support this global effort._
* _We will seek to mobilize the private sector to see how and where they can contribute._
* _We will seek to create a pool of experienced judges and prosecutors who would be willing to work on these projects on short-notice._
* _We will take steps to ensure that gaps in United States’ law do not allow persons wanted or indicted for genocide, war crimes, or crimes against humanity to seek safe haven on our soil in hopes of evading justice._

_And when violations occur that are so grave and that they breach international peace and security, the United States will use its position in the UN Security Council to act in support of justice.”\]_

In its second term, the Bush Administration adopted what the 2009 ASIL Task Force Report described as “a more nuanced and pragmatic approach to the ICC.” A watershed moment came with rising concern over the atrocities unfolding in Darfur, Sudan, which ultimately led the United States to acquiesce to the Security Council referring the situation in Darfur to the ICC Prosecutor (see XXX below). The rationale was plain: the tangible need for “the international community to work together in order to end the climate of impunity in the Sudan” simply outweighed the conceptual objections of the United States to the ICC. The changes in approach to the ICC during the second term of President Bush were not limited to this referral. It further came to believe that ASPA restrictions on military aid to states that had not signed “Article 98 agreements” were counterproductive, leading Congress to repeal some provisions of ASPA (described in section XXX below). Over time, the United States indicated a growing openness to supporting specific activities of the ICC when it considered them to be consistent with U.S. interests.

It was in this context that the earlier ASIL-convened Task Force issued its recommendations in 2009. The 2009 Report observed that U.S. policy towards the Court had begun to evolve into what that Task Force considered to be an “increasingly positive attitude toward the Court, in particular supporting its eﬀorts in Darfur.” The Report thus set out 13 recommendations in this vein (ten for the President and three for Congress) to articulate and consolidate a continued policy of positive engagement with the Court, but did not recommend that the United States ratify the Rome Statute.

In the end, many of the report’s concrete suggestions were, in fact, eventually reflected in the Obama Administration’s “case by case” policy for providing support to the ICC. Among notable examples of the key support it provided, the United States played an instrumental role in the surrender to the ICC of two suspects who had evaded capture for over eight years: Bosco Ntaganda, a DRC militia leader who turned himself in to the U.S. embassy in Kigali, Rwanda, and Dominic Ongwen, a senior commander of the Lord’s Resistance Army who came into the custody of U.S. special forces in the Central African Republic (see XXX below). In addition, the United States voted in favor of the U.N. Security Council referring Libya to the Court in 2011; resisted efforts by Sudan and Kenya to seek an Article 16 deferral from the Security Council (see XXX, below); and expanded the War Crimes Rewards Program to include ICC indictees. Toward the end of the Obama Administration, however, this approach came under increasing pressure due to concerns that the ICC’s Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) would open formal investigations in the situations in Afghanistan and Palestine, which might make it more difficult for the United States to maintain its previous supportive stance.

The Trump Administration pursued a very different policy. At first, there was little public manifestation of the Administration’s stance toward the Court. As described in more detail in section XXX, this changed with the appointment of John Bolton as National Security Advisor in March 2018 and culminated in sanctions imposed under a June 2020 Executive Order that deemed the ICC to be an “unusual and extraordinary threat” to national security. This move generated sharp criticism from members of the Assembly of States Parties (including U.S. friends and allies), civil society organizations, and academics. Even non-party states such as China took the opportunity to weigh in in opposition to the U.S. approach.

The United States is now emerging from a period of its history during which its actions have caused many to question its commitment to accountability and to constructive and respectful engagement in international and multilateral affairs. The reaction by the Trump administration to the ICC has been seen by longstanding allies as extreme and as emboldening autocrats in their own attacks on the rule of law and judicial institutions. Meanwhile, the rhetoric and circumstances surrounding the pardons issued to U.S. servicemembers and private military contractors who were accused or convicted of war crimes have triggered questions about the commitment of the United States to hold to account Americans who commit heinous international crimes. Numerous interlocutors with whom we spoke maintained that these outcomes also undermine the credibility of statements from senior U.S. Government officials that “\[w\]hen our personnel are accused of a crime, they face justice in our country.”

The Task Force undertook its work as these events were unfolding. This Report has been informed by discussions, individually or in small focus groups, between members of the Task Force and over 100 current and former U.S. government officials, foreign diplomats, members of civil society, academics, and practitioners. This includes U.S. and foreign ambassadors and other diplomatic staff who have served in ICC situation countries or in countries where indictees have traveled; other U.S. government officials who serve or have served in a range of roles, working on issues relevant to the U.S. relationship with the ICC from varying perspectives and under both Republican and Democratic administrations; national prosecutors and other state authorities managing complementarity processes in their home jurisdictions; individuals involved in the military justice system; ICC personnel, including current and former judges, defense counsel, victims’ counsel, and prosecutors; former Presidents of the Assembly of States Parties, Presidents and Registrars of the Court and candidates for the position of ICC Chief Prosecutor; victim representatives and organizations of lawyers and physicians working with survivors, including within the ICC; practitioners of all stripes, including individuals pressing for accountability for those responsible for abuses and those defending individuals who might be deemed responsible; representatives of non-governmental organizations (NGOs), U.S. and foreign, working in ICC situation countries, including in Afghanistan; and individuals who worked directly on ICC-related legislation, including ASPA and the War Crimes Rewards Program. Many of these individuals have held multiple relevant roles, and so have observed the U.S.-ICC relationship from multiple perspectives. We also attended academic and other convenings devoted to the U.S.-ICC relationship and the situations under consideration before the Court.

The analysis and recommendations that follow are drawn from these rich discussions, and the Task Force has endeavored to reflect the multifaceted views of our many interlocutors on these issues in this report. The next sections will outline the legal and political backdrop against which these events have transpired and then address key developments involving the Court that will bear on pragmatic options going forward.

2. The Operative Legal Framework

This section offers a brief discussion of the legislative framework governing U.S. government interactions with the ICC under domestic law. Some of the relevant pieces of legislation are ICC-specific, whereas others are supportive of international justice efforts more broadly, including in ICC situation countries.

1. ICC-Specific Legislative Framework

The primary legislation governing U.S. relations with the ICC is the American Servicemembers Protection Act (ASPA), which was enacted on August 2, 2002. The focus of this legislation, as the name and the Congressional findings make clear, was the protection of U.S. servicemembers from the Court. Key provisions prohibit any extradition from the United States to the ICC or support for any transfer of a U.S. citizen or permanent resident to the ICC; prohibit any funding to assist in the investigation, arrest, detention, extradition, or prosecution of any U.S. citizens or permanent residents by the ICC; and authorize the President to use “all means necessary”—a phrase that is understood to include military force—to bring about the release of U.S. persons that might be detained by or on behalf of the Court. \[_See text box with text of provisions_\].

_\[TEXT BOX: Key restrictions in ASPA include:_

_s. 2004(b) PROHIBITION ON RESPONDING TO REQUESTS FOR COOPERATION.—Notwithstanding section 1782 of title 28, United States Code, or any other provision of law, no United States Court, and no agency or entity of any State or local government, including any court, may cooperate with the International Criminal Court in response to a request for cooperation submitted by the International Criminal Court pursuant to the Rome Statute. …_

_(e) PROHIBITION ON PROVISION OF SUPPORT TO THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT.—Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no agency or entity of the United States Government or of any State or local government, including any court, may provide support to the International Criminal Court…._

_(h) PROHIBITION ON INVESTIGATIVE ACTIVITIES OF AGENTS.—No agent of the International Criminal Court may conduct, in the United States or any territory subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, any investigative activity relating to a preliminary inquiry, investigation, prosecution, or other proceeding at the International Criminal Court._

_s. 2013(12): The term “support” means assistance of any kind, including financial support, transfer of property or other material support, services, intelligence sharing, law enforcement cooperation, the training or detail of personnel, and the arrest or detention of individuals\]_

Other provisions in ASPA impose restrictions on the United States’ ability to support or cooperate with the ICC—including the provision of financial support, services, or law enforcement cooperation; the transfer of property or other material support; intelligence sharing; the training or detail of personnel; the arrest or detention of individuals, the ability of U.S. courts and state and local governmental entities to respond to ICC requests for cooperation, and ICC investigative activity in the United States. These restrictions are subject, however, to a significant exception introduced by Senator Christopher Dodd, whose father was a prosecutor at Nuremberg. Specifically, the Dodd Amendment provides that nothing in ASPA shall prohibit the United States from assisting international efforts to bring to justice foreign nationals accused of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes. Thus, under the plain language of the Dodd Amendment, the many restrictions on cooperation and support under ASPA do not apply to the extent that they involve the rendering of assistance to proceedings against individual defendants being prosecuted for the three crimes then within the ICC’s jurisdiction.

_\[TEXT BOX: Nothing in this title shall prohibit the United States from rendering assistance to international efforts to bring to justice Saddam Hussein, Slobodan Milosovic \[sic\], Osama bin Laden, other members of Al Queda \[sic\], leaders of Islamic Jihad, and other foreign nationals accused of genocide, war crimes or crimes against humanity_.\]

The Dodd Amendment is capacious, but there are situations that it does not cover. For example, it does not apply to any assistance to prosecutions of U.S. nationals, to efforts to prosecute any defendant for the crime of aggression, and at least arguably to general institutional support to the ICC that is not sufficiently connected to efforts to bring particular _individuals_ to justice (e.g., generalized capacity building). That said, the identification of individuals who had not yet been indicted by any court, and the inclusion of categories of perpetrators, such as “other members of Al Queda” and “leaders of Islamic Jihad,” at least suggest that the Dodd Amendment does not require a criminal case to have been commenced and may include supporting efforts to investigate the responsibility of a group whose members are understood to be exclusively or predominantly not American with a view “to bring\[ing them\] to justice.” Furthermore, there are questions whether this exception should be interpreted to overcome restrictions on the ability of the ICC to conduct investigative activity in the United States in support of cases that would otherwise fall within the Dodd Amendment_._ Nevertheless, the Dodd Amendment creates significant flexibility for the United States to provide a range of forms of support for investigations or prosecutions for atrocity crimes of foreign nationals if it is so inclined.

Separate provisions of ASPA highlight the United States’ evolving relationship with the ICC and the multiple interests at play. For example, as originally enacted, ASPA contained restrictions on the provision of military assistance to states parties that did not enter into agreements pursuant to Article 98 of the Rome Statute to prevent the surrender of U.S. persons to the Court. At least 100 states ratified such agreements between late 2002 and 2007, though a number of states (including all of our NATO allies other than Turkey) refused to do so. Over time, however, U.S. officials came to see these restrictions on military assistance as counter-productive, with the then-Commander of U.S. Southern Command, General Bantz Craddock, testifying that “loss of engagement prevents the development of long-term relationships with future \[Latin American\] military and civilian leaders.” In addition, concerns emerged that the restrictions enabled foreign adversaries, including China, to step into the vacuum left by the United States and to build credibility and cooperative relationships with countries with which the United States traditionally had close relationships. In May 2006, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice memorably described prioritizing opposition to the ICC over other U.S. interests as amounting to “sort of the same as shooting ourselves in the foot.” As these concerns came to the fore, Congress repealed the restrictions and the Bush Administration discontinued its efforts to secure additional such Article 98 agreements.

In addition to ASPA, an earlier statute has been interpreted as providing certain limitations on U.S. engagement with the Court that are not subject to the Dodd Amendment. Section 705(b) of the FY-2000-01 Foreign Relations Authorizations Act (FRAA) restricts any funding “for use by, or support of, the International Criminal Court” unless and until the United States ratifies the Rome Statute. \[See Text Box\].

_\[TEXT BOX: None of the funds authorized to be appropriated by this or any other Act may be obligated for use by, or for support of, the International Criminal Court unless the United States has become a party to the Court pursuant to a treaty made under Article II, section 2, clause 2 of the Constitution of the United States on or after the date of enactment of this Act.\]_

2. War Crimes Rewards Program

Under separate legislation, the United States can offer rewards up to $5 million under the War Crimes Rewards Program (WCRP) for “information that leads to the arrest, transfer, or conviction of designated defendants accused of crimes against humanity, genocide, or war crimes.” In 2013, Congress—with strong bipartisan support—expanded this program to allow the Secretary of State to authorize rewards for “information leading to ... the transfer to or conviction by _any_ international criminal tribunal ... of any foreign national accused of war crimes, crimes against humanity, or genocide.” Soon thereafter, in May 2013, the State Department offered rewards of up to $5 million under the WCRP for information on three suspects from the Lord’s Resistance Army for whom the ICC had issued arrest warrants: Joseph Kony, Okot Odhiambo, and Dominic Ongwen. The United States also later offered a reward for information on Bosco Ntaganda. (Two of these suspects, Ongwen and Ntaganda, were subsequently surrendered to the Court with assistance of the United States, see XXX below).

3. Other Atrocities Prevention and Response Legislation

There are other pieces of legislation that, while not directly affecting the ability of the United States to engage with the Court, are nevertheless relevant for a general understanding of the framework in which policy towards engagement with the Court is made, including laws sharpening the United States’ commitment to preventing and responding to atrocity crimes and to supporting accountability when international crimes are committed. These include the Elie Wiesel Genocide and Atrocity Prevention Act, the Global Fragility Act, the FY2021 [National Defense Authorization Act](https://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20201207/CRPT-116hrpt617.pdf), the Women, Peace, and Security Act of 2017; the Syrian War Crime Accountability [Act of 2017](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/905); and the Iraq & Syria Genocide Accountability [Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/390#:\~:text=Iraq%20and%20Syria%20Genocide%20Relief%20and%20Accountability%20Act,assist%20in%20prosecuting%20those%20suspected%20of%20such%20crimes.) of 2018. The ICC is an important player in many of the states that inspired, or are affected by, these pieces of legislation. For example, the initial Executive Branch reports under the Elie Wiesel Act highlight U.S. support for documentation and accountability of atrocities in Burma (Myanmar), which are subject to an ICC investigation. To the extent that existing or future legislation requires reporting on, or appropriates resources to support, documentation and accountability efforts, there will be additional overlap with the activities of the ICC.

The United States also maintains a range of programs that impose sanctions on individuals, both country-specific regimes and those addressed to types of deleterious conduct, including global terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD), drug trafficking, and serious human rights abuses or corruption (exemplified by the Global Magnitsky Act sanctions regime). The intersection of these authorities and the activities of the Court is not theoretical: the United States has imposed sanctions against at least 13 individuals whom the ICC had charged with international crimes (six of whom remain at large). The United States has also established country-specific sanctions regimes covering eight situations in which the ICC is investigating or conducting a preliminary examination.

3. U.S. Engagement with the ICC

With an eye toward exploring options for the new administration, this section outlines the history of U.S. engagement with the Court, including the provision of various forms of assistance and support over the years. The section highlights that whatever the state of U.S. policy toward the ICC, there are multiple fora in which the United States will interface with ICC-related issues, suggesting the need for a pragmatic approach that stays focused on core concerns and leaves space for the United States to advance international justice and other efforts.

1. U.S. Interactions with the ICC in the United Nations

The ICC is involved in various ways in many states that also find themselves on the agenda of the U.N. Security Council or other U.N. bodies, because they are hosting U.N. peacekeeping missions, are subject to proposals for the Security Council to refer them to the Court or to defer investigations or prosecutions, or more generally in other contexts.

1. Peacekeeping

The ICC can interface with U.N. peacekeeping missions in a range of ways. One of the earliest interactions involved the United States’ attempt to seek language in resolutions authorizing peacekeeping missions that would exempt the nationals of sending non-party states from the jurisdiction of the ICC. These efforts proved controversial and produced mixed results (see text box). In addition, the ICC also has jurisdiction over attacks on peacekeepers as a war crime. However, the most frequent interaction between peacekeeping missions and the ICC arises from the fact that many such missions are, or have been, underway in ICC situation countries—notably in the eastern DRC (MONUC and MONUSCO), but also in CAR (MINURCAT and MINUSCA), Darfur (UNAMID), Côte d’Ivoire (UNOCI), and Mali (MINUSMA). Such missions will almost inevitably have (or have access to) information and evidence that would be relevant to ICC investigations. They may also interact with persons who whom the ICC is investigating or has issued arrest warrants for and may be in a position to assist with security or logistics for ICC investigators or witnesses. All of which raises inevitable questions about the proper role and authority of U.N. peacekeeping missions in collecting information and evidence of relevance to ICC investigations, or whether the Council should take other action supportive of the ICC.

In some cases, the United States helped frame peacekeeping mandates that affirmatively authorized the missions to cooperate with the ICC. For example, Security Council resolutions on the DRC and CAR reiterated the need for accountability, noted that many of the crimes fall within the jurisdiction of the ICC, noted or welcomed the cooperation of national authorities with the Court, and invoked the United Nations’ “no contact policy” in dealing with persons subject to ICC arrest warrants or summonses. In Mali, the Security Council authorized the U.N. peacekeeping force to support the efforts of local authorities to bring to justice those responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity “taking into account the referral by the transitional authorities of Mali of the situation in their country since January 2012 to the International Criminal Court.”

_\[Peacekeeping Box: Immediately following the Rome Statute’s entry into force, the United States sought an omnibus Security Council resolution that would permanently prevent the ICC from asserting jurisdiction over acts of the nationals of non-party states involved in peacekeeping operations established or authorized by the Security Council. In pursuit of this goal, the United States went so far as to veto a June 2002 resolution that would have extended the peacekeeping operation in Bosnia-Hercegovina but would not have provided such protection. Shortly thereafter, as part of a compromise, the Security Council adopted Resolution 1422, which invoked Article 16 of the Rome Statute and requested the Court to refrain from commencing or proceeding with an investigation or prosecution of any cases “involving current or former officials or personnel from a contributing State not a Party to the Rome Statute over acts or omissions relating to a United Nations established or authorized operation.” Although the provision applied for only one year, paragraph 2 expressed the Council’s intent to renew the request annually “for further 12-month periods for as long as may be necessary,” and the Council did renew the deferral the following year. However, in 2004 against the background of allegations of detainee abuse from Abu Ghraib, the Council dropped the provision._

_Soon thereafter, in connection with the establishment of a multinational force in Liberia in which it was anticipated that United States personnel would play an important role, the Security Council issued a resolution indicating that personnel from a contributing state that was not a Rome Statute party would be “subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of that contributing State for all alleged acts or omissions arising out of or related to the” new force. Unlike the earlier resolutions, which invoked Article 16, this provision applied permanently, though only to the force in Liberia. At the same time, as written, the Liberia resolution would strip not just the ICC but other states (and other tribunals) from any otherwise applicable jurisdiction. Given that Liberia itself was not a Rome Statute party at the time, the ICC would not in any case have had jurisdiction over conduct in the country by nationals of states that were not Rome Statute parties. This language was controversial and it was excluded from subsequent resolutions.\]_

2. Referrals of Situations to the ICC Prosecutor

Under Article 13(b) of the Rome Statute, the Court can exercise jurisdiction over a case if the Security Council, acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, refers the situation to the Prosecutor. Many observers initially believed that U.S. antagonism toward the Court would prevent the Council from exercising this authority. But a key turning point came with rising concern over the atrocities unfolding in Darfur, Sudan. The State Department had deployed an interdisciplinary team into the field to investigate the nature of the atrocities and, based on the team’s findings, Secretary of State Colin Powell testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in September 2004 that “genocide has occurred and may still be occurring in Darfur.” Not long thereafter, British, French, and other representatives of U.N. member states began advocating for a referral of the situation to the ICC Prosecutor. The United States initially worked to divert this possibility, proposing alternatives for a hybrid or _ad hoc_ tribunal along the lines of the ICTY and ICTR. However, when those proposals floundered, the Bush Administration was faced with a decision whether to deploy the U.S. veto in the Security Council to block the referral. At the end of the day, “the President was more concerned about the atrocities in Sudan than he was about the ICC,” and the United States allowed the Council to effectuate the referral, saying that “the need for the international community to work together in order to end the climate of impunity in the Sudan” outweighed its objections to the ICC.

U.S. acquiescence to the Security Council referral came in the form of an abstention, rather than an affirmative vote for the resolution. In order to obtain U.S. agreement to abstain, the resolution included language that protected personnel from states not parties to the Rome Statute—including the United States—for acts related to the peacekeeping mission in Sudan (modeled on the Liberia resolution) and language that “recognizes” that none of the Court’s expenses in the investigation or prosecutions would be borne by the United Nations. The United States subsequently provided ongoing political support to the ICC investigation in Darfur through its stance in the Security Council.

In 2011, the United States took a more proactive role when it co-sponsored a Security Council referral of the situation in Libya to the ICC. In voting for the resolution, Ambassador Susan Rice stated, “\[w\]e are pleased to have supported this entire resolution and all of its measures including the referral to the ICC (International Criminal Court). We are happy to have the opportunity to co-sponsor this, and we think it is a very powerful message to the leadership of Libya that this heinous killing must stop and that individuals will be held personally accountable.”

In 2014, the United States also voted in favor of a resolution to refer the situation in Syria to the ICC, a draft that was formally supported by sixty-five states by the time it went to a vote (almost a third of U.N. membership) and which contained many of the same provisions that had been included in the earlier resolutions at the behest of the United States, including jurisdictional carveouts for personnel from states that were not Rome Statute parties. The resolution garnered the support of thirteen Council members but, predictably, was vetoed by Russia and China.

With respect to the two situations that the Council did refer to the Court, the ICC Prosecutor reports every six months to the Council on progress she has made and, consistent with general practice in the Council, the U.S. and other Council members are invited to make formal statements in response. In recent years, when the U.S. relationship with the Court has been antagonistic, the United States appears to have gone to great lengths to avoid praising the Court’s work. For example, in response to recent briefings by the ICC Prosecutor on Libya and Sudan, the U.S. representative found himself in the unenviable position of lamenting the impunity enjoyed by individuals for whom the ICC had issued arrest warrants but conspicuously unable to call for the surrender of the suspects to the Court. Although he acknowledged that an individual who was finally surrendered to the Court after 13 years “is in custody \[and\] must be held accountable for his alleged abuses,” he conspicuously did not welcome this surrender or even mention the ICC.

Meanwhile, the United States’ anti-ICC posture also imposed political costs and interfered with the ability of the United States to achieve its objectives in other ways. For example, in recent briefings, a number of states—both adversaries and allies—addressed the imposition of sanctions, for example “deplor\[ing\] the application of sanctions against the Court, and in particular against its Prosecutor and the members of her Office, as well as the continued threats by United States authorities \[…which\] is an attack on our core values and interests;” “oppos\[ing\] unilateral sanctions \[which constitute\] bullying practices and power politics, as they undermine the international order based on international law;” or “denounce\[ing\] the grave injustice against the world’s first and only permanent international criminal court and its officials through unilateral coercive measures in the form of sanctions \[which\] are unjustifiable and wrong \[and\] flagrantly violate our international rules-based system.”

_\[TEXT BOX: China took note of the fact: “that the Prosecutor and other officials of the ICC are being subjected to unilateral sanctions that many countries are condemning. China always opposes unilateral sanctions, as they are inconsistent with international law. We also oppose bullying practices and power politics, as they undermine the international order based on international law.” Id. Later, China reiterated that “\[m\]any countries, including many members of the Security Council today, have condemned \[the sanctions\]. China has always opposed unilateral sanctions that are inconsistent with international law.” U.N. Doc. S/2020/1192, 21 December 2020.\]_

3. Proposals to Defer ICC Investigations or Cases

Article 16 of the Rome Statute provides that the Security Council may request the deferral of any investigation or prosecution by the ICC under a resolution adopted under Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter. The most prominent calls for the Security Council to exercise this authority came in response to concerns by some states regarding ICC efforts to prosecute then-Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir and Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta and Vice President William Ruto. The United States opposed these deferrals under both the Bush and Obama Administrations. Indeed, the United States abstained on a resolution extending the peacekeeping mission in Darfur in 2008 that included language that suggested that the Council would “consider” the African Union’s Peace and Security Council’s proposal to request a deferral for the Darfur investigation. In its explanation of vote, the U.S. representative explained that the reference to Article 16 sent the wrong message to al-Bashir and others who might be brought to justice.

4. Other U.N. Resolutions Referring to the ICC

U.S. constraints and concerns regarding the ICC have been a recurring point of discussion and disagreement with allies involved in negotiating the texts of resolutions and reports that refer to the Court. For example, the U.N. General Assembly annually passes a resolution on the ICC following the ICC’s submission of its annual _Report of the International Criminal Court_ to the United Nations. Until 2000, the United States had joined consensus on this resolution, but from 2001 to 2009 it dissociated from consensus—the only state to do so except in 2008 when it was in the company of Sudan. In doing so, the United States typically highlighted its longstanding concerns about the Rome Statute, emphasized its commitment to justice (referring to its disagreements as being about means, not ends), and expressed its regret that, although it recognized the right of states to become party to the Statute, other states had been unwilling to acknowledge in the resolution the right of states to decide not to ratify the treaty. This approach changed in 2010, when the United States joined consensus on the resolution until 2018. In 2017, the first year of the Trump Administration, the United States joined consensus while urging the ICC to respect “genuine domestic efforts to promote justice for atrocity crimes.” In 2018 and thereafter, the United States once again dissociated from consensus, while reiterating its objection to the Court’s assertion of jurisdiction over nationals of states that are not Rome Statute parties and about the then-proposed investigation of U.S. personnel in Afghanistan.

ICC issues arise in the General Assembly in other ways as well. This includes resolutions in support of the Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar; decrying trafficking in women and girls, extra-judicial killings, and torture; denouncing human rights violations in Syria and North Korea; supporting victims of armed conflict and the safety and security of humanitarian and U.N. personnel; calling for the protection of educational institutions from attack; and promoting the rights of the child and of internally displaced persons. During certain periods, the United States has opposed, abstained, or dissociated from consensus on such resolutions that it would otherwise support because of references to the ICC in the text. Many of our interlocutors told us that the net result had been to diminish U.S. credibility on issues of international justice generally and waste the expenditure of political capital on trifling text with little actual impact.

Similarly, beyond the direct referral or deferral of investigations and the mandates of peacekeeping missions, a range of other Security Council resolutions and statements intersect with the mandate of the ICC. Under the Bush Administration, the United States generally resisted the inclusion of references to the ICC. Over time, however, the approach became more pragmatic, including for example in the support provided by the United States for Resolution 1688, under which the Council facilitated efforts to have the trial of Charles Taylor held at the premises of the International Criminal Court in The Hague. In later resolutions, the Council made affirmative references to the ICC in resolutions addressing the rule of law and the fight against impunity; women, peace, and security; the protection of civilians, journalists, and children in and affected by conflict; conflict prevention and peacekeeping; and individual ICC situation countries. Likewise, in the U.N. Human Rights Council, during the last two years that the United States was a member, the ICC came up in a number of contexts, including resolutions devoted to North Korea, Syria, Libya, Mali, Myanmar, the prevention of genocide, the protection of cultural heritage, and extrajudicial killings.

2. U.S. Engagement on the Crime of Aggression and the Kampala Review Conference

As noted above, by the time that the Rome Statute entered into force in July 2002, the United States declined to exercise its right to participate as an observer in the Assembly of States Parties (ASP). It also eschewed meetings of the Special Working Group on the Crime of Aggression convened by the ASP to develop proposed amendments to the Rome Statute on the crime of aggression. Specifically, from 2003 to 2009, the Special Working Group periodically met and reported to the ASP on its progress on proposed amendments to be considered at a future Review Conference to define the crime of aggression and set out the conditions under which the Court would be able to exercise jurisdiction over the crime. In the absence of the United States, states eventually agreed on a package that, while ostensibly based on the principle that “nothing was decided until everything was decided,” in fact represented consensus on all but two related issues: the role of the Security Council and how the amendments would enter into force.

When the Obama Administration took office, the United States re-engaged on these issues. Obama Administration officials concluded that, in addition to its strong interests in the two bracketed issues, it saw deep flaws in the definition on which the Special Working Group had reached consensus. For their part, however, the participating states were understandably unwilling to re-open the text upon which they had agreed after seven years of painstaking negotiations from which the United States had absented itself. Those involved in the process believe there is little doubt that the definition would have avoided these flaws if the United States had participated in the negotiations and made its views known.

The United States then embarked upon extensive diplomatic efforts to address its concerns, including by sending a large interagency delegation, with representatives from Congress as public members, to the Review Conference held in Kampala, Uganda, in 2010. Despite the fact that the wording of the definition was treated as “locked,” the United States persuaded its partners to adopt a series of “Understandings” regarding how the definition would be interpreted. Even more importantly, the final package included provisions that prevent the Court from exercising jurisdiction over the crime of aggression with respect to United States nationals and sharply limit the Court’s jurisdiction with respect to other states as well. In the end, the United States engagement resulted in the adoption of a set of amendments that were highly protective of United States interests. As summarized in a bipartisan Senate Foreign Relations Committee staff report, active U.S. participation at the Kampala Conference played a crucial role in securing these protections. Said the report:

Absent U.S. participation and engagement before and during the Kampala Conference, it is unlikely that the conference would have specifically exempted non-ICC parties from key portions of the proposed aggression regime. It is also unlikely that the conference would have adopted understandings to address ambiguities in aspects of the definition of aggression.

In addition, the United States participated actively at Kampala on other issues of significant concern to both the Defense and State Departments, and was able to secure language protecting their interests in a separate resolution on amendments to the Rome Statute’s definition of war crimes. The United States was also the only non-member state to engage in the pledging exercise conducted in connection with the Review Conference, with a pledge to, among other things, “support efforts to bring the resistance of the Lord’s Resistance Army to justice” along with rule of law and capacity building projects to enhance states’ abilities to hold accountable those responsible for international crimes.

3. Other U.S. Interactions with the Assembly of States Parties

In addition to its involvement on finalizing the aggression amendments, the United States actively participated as an observer in the meetings of the Assembly of States Parties throughout the Obama Administration. Its interventions consistently noted those areas in which the United States had concerns, but did so in a manner that was widely perceived as constructive. For example, in the first meeting that the United States attended as an observer, Ambassador-at-Large for Global Criminal Justice Stephen Rapp said—

\[the United States has\] a deep appreciation of the role that institutions of international justice can play in helping restore accountability and the rule of law to state struggling to emerge from lawless violence. Certainly, the U.S. Government places the greatest importance on assisting countries where the rule of law has been shattered to stand up their own system of protection and accountability—to enhance their capacity to ensure justice at home. At the same time, the United States recognizes that there are certain times when justice will be found only when the international community unites in ensuring it, and we have been steadfast in our encouragement for action when the situation demands it.

The U.S. posture changed significantly during the Trump Administration. Attendance at the meetings of the Assembly of States Parties was sporadic. For example, in the most recent meeting of the ASP before the Covid-19 epidemic in December 2019, the United States did register to attend the ASP, but did not send a senior official, did not have a representative sit behind the U.S. placard, and did not make any formal interventions. This stands in stark contrast with, for example, the Chinese delegation, which was led by their Deputy Director-General of the Department of Treaty and Law, who took the opportunity to promote Chinese positions, made formal statements that highlighted areas where the government had “common ground” with the ICC and had worked “in a constructive manner,” and contrasted the Chinese approach with that of other states who were engaged in “unilateralism bullying.”

4. Support of ICC Investigations

As described above, and as confirmed by interlocutors involved at the time, the United States during the Bush Administration provided occasional support for ICC activities where United States and ICC interests aligned. For its part, the Obama Administration adopted a policy of providing support on a case-by-case basis where consistent with U.S. interests and permissible under U.S. law. This section describes in more detail some of the types of support and assistance that the United States provided under this framework.

We have already discussed the situation in Darfur, in which the United States during the Bush administration made a decision at the Presidential level to permit the Security Council to refer the situation to the ICC Prosecutor. The United States provided strong political support in various forms thereafter, including publicly stating that the United States would cooperate with the Court if it requested information for its Darfur investigation and abstaining from a resolution authorizing the U.N. mission in Darfur (UNAMID) that contained language that implied the prospect of a deferral of the Darfur investigation under Article 16 of the Rome Statute.

1. Operational Field Support

In other cases, support was provided “in the field.” Though all phases of the U.S.-ICC relationship, dating back to even before the Darfur referral, there was sharing of information between U.S. diplomatic and defense personnel on the ground and ICC actors (including investigators and victims’ representatives) in countries where the ICC was investigating (or where indictees were present). This exchange of information reflected the imperatives of the situation on the ground, in often dangerous environments with limited information sources, and the recognition of a shared mission to pursue justice and accountability for the victims of atrocity crimes. In particular, according to one interlocutor, U.S. and ICC field personnel shared information on developments within the Lord’s Resistance Army, and the United States helped to spread information in northern Uganda on the ICC’s activities to reduce support for the LRA and induce defections.

U.S. activity intensified thereafter, with efforts focused on the role of LRA Commander Joseph Kony, who had been subject to an ICC arrest warrant since 2005. The Lord’s Resistance Army Disarmament and Northern Uganda Recovery Act, signed into law by President Obama in 2010, stated that it is the policy of the United States to “work vigorously” to:

eliminat\[e\] the threat posed by the Lord’s Resistance Army to civilians and regional stability through political, economic, military, and intelligence support for a comprehensive multilateral effort to protect civilians in affected areas, to apprehend or otherwise remove Joseph Kony and his top commanders from the battlefield, and to disarm and demobilize Lord’s Resistance Army fighters; and … further support comprehensive reconstruction, transitional justice, and reconciliation efforts.

Indeed, in its pledge in Kampala, the United States “reaffirm\[ed\] President Obama’s recognition … that we must renew our commitments and strengthen our capabilities to protect and assist civilians caught in the \[Lord’s Resistance Army’s\] wake, to receive those that surrender, and to support efforts to bring the LRA leadership to justice.” In 2011, President Obama, with bipartisan support, launched Operation Observant Compass and sent 100 combat-equipped military advisors drawn from U.S. Special Operations Forces to assist the Ugandan Peoples Defence Forces and an African Union Regional Task Force (AU-RTF) in their efforts to track Kony and remove him “or his top commanders from the battlefield.” This was on top of the provision of substantial matériel (including communications equipment, logistical support, tactical equipment (e.g., night vision goggles), and vehicles) to this initiative.

2. Support in the Arrest and Surrender of Fugitives

As noted above, the United States extended its War Crimes Reward Program (WCRP) in 2013 to enable it to offer rewards for information leading to the transfer and conviction of specific foreign nationals to the ICC and offered such rewards for four ICC suspects. However, its support for the arrest and surrender of fugitives goes beyond merely offering rewards. Perhaps the most tangible U.S. contribution to the work of the Court has been its critical operational role in the surrender of two of the highest profile fugitives to the ICC. The United States first facilitated the transfer of former Congolese militia leader Bosco Ntaganda, who had been subject to an outstanding ICC arrest warrant since 2006 (although it was not unsealed until 2008), to The Hague after he turned himself in at the U.S. Embassy in Kigali, Rwanda, in 2013, shortly after being named on the WCRP list. In 2019, Ntaganda was convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for thirty years for the commission of crimes against humanity and war crimes, including murder, rape, sexual slavery, persecution, intentionally attacking civilians, and conscripting children into an armed group.

Similarly, United States forces operating in Central Africa in 2015 facilitated the transfer to the ICC of Dominic Ongwen, one of the five commanders of the Lord’s Resistance Army who had been subject to outstanding arrest warrants since 2005 and who had surrendered himself to Central African Republic forces. In February 2021, Ongwen was convicted of a similar litany of crimes against humanity and war crimes, including a number of gender-based crimes (forced marriage, torture, rape, sexual slavery, enslavement, forced pregnancy and outrages upon personal dignity). The United States welcomed the verdict, recalling its role in facilitating Ongwen’s transfer and the outstanding reward for information leading to the arrest, transfer, or conviction of the LRA defendants under the War Crimes Rewards Program, and reiterated that it “stands with all the victims of Ongwen and the LRA.”

3. Protection of Witnesses

The United States has also assisted in providing protection to vulnerable witnesses who are assisting with ICC investigations or prosecutions and need protection. Ambassador Rapp highlighted the willingness of the United States to provide related technical support on witness protection at the November 2012 meeting of the ICC Assembly of States Parties:

On witness protection, we seek to focus international resources and attention on these challenges, both at the national and international level. As you may recall, last year, we co-hosted a side event at the ASP on this topic. We have offered assistance and training to states seeking to protect witnesses in their own cases. We have worked with the ICC to respond positively to its requests for assistance relating to witness protection issues. And various parts of the U.S. government, including the Departments of Justice and State, are currently seeking to strengthen and expand our capacity to assist courts and tribunals on the protection of witnesses and judicial personnel.

Interlocutors report that the Obama Administration provided protection to at least two witnesses involved in an ICC prosecution, at a time when it was difficult to secure assistance from any other state, and that the United States offered one of the best opportunities for these vulnerable and traumatized individuals to remake their lives in safety. However, in practice the provision of witness protection in the form of resettlement to the United States has been limited because of restrictions under ASPA, which have been interpreted to prevent the ICC from conducting at least some kinds of interviews with witnesses who are on U.S. territory, thus complicating the ability of witnesses located in the United States to participate in ongoing investigations or trials. Nevertheless, various arrangements have been made under which witnesses were able to travel to third countries to meet with OTP staff and thus not encounter difficulties under the legislation.

4. Support for Victims

The United States has provided extensive humanitarian assistance and other funding to support victim communities in a number of situation countries in which the ICC is investigating, including the DRC and CAR, and in connection with Rohingya victims who have fled to Bangladesh. The United States has not in the past provided contributions to the Trust Fund for Victims established by the Assembly of States Parties under Article 79 of the Rome Statute; however, although—as discussed below—this may well be something the new Administration will want to explore.

5. Evidence/Information to Support Investigations

During the second term of the Bush administration, the United States indicated that, at least with respect to the ICC investigation it supported in Darfur, the United States would provide help if requested by the ICC. Thus, Deputy Secretary of State Robert B. Zoellick stated in April 2006 that “if they \[the ICC\] ask for information and help, we try to provide that help,” and that “we will fully cooperate with it and pursue those actions as related to the genocide in Darfur.” In general, requests for assistance from the ICC have been submitted confidentially, and there is no public record of the United States having actually provided specific evidence to the ICC in support of the investigation or prosecution of any foreign nationals. However, the United States has publicly stated its openness to doing so. Ambassador-at-Large for War Crimes Issues Stephen Rapp noted that “the United States has worked with the ICC to identify practical ways to advance our mutual goals, on a case-by-case basis and consistent with U.S. policy and laws.” More recently, even with the ICC investigation into the situation in Afghanistan pending, a State Department spokesperson reportedly stated that the United States may cooperate with the ICC in “exceptional cases.”

6. Public and Diplomatic Statements

U.S. strategic messaging regarding the ICC has ranged from statements of serious concern about the Court, as part of efforts to undermine the institution, to statements of diplomatic support, at the level of both policy and with respect to specific activities. Public statements attacking the legitimacy of the ICC were common in the early years of the Bush Administration. During the Trump Administration, National Security Adviser John Bolton and Secretary of State Michael Pompeo made similar statements after the ICC Prosecutor announced that she would request authorization to investigate crimes committed in Afghanistan that would encompass allegations against U.S. persons. Thus, National Security Adviser Bolton sharply criticized the Court in September 2018, saying among other things:

We will not cooperate with the ICC. We will provide no assistance to the ICC. We will not join the ICC. We will let the ICC dies on its own. After all, for all intents and purposes, the ICC is already dead to us.

Meanwhile, in connection with the issuance of sanctions against the Prosecutor, Secretary Pompeo said “\[w\]e cannot, we will not stand by as our people are threatened by a kangaroo court,” later referring to the ICC as “a thoroughly broken and corrupted institution.”

At other times, however, the United States expressed diplomatic support for the Court and, indeed, Ambassador-at-Large Rapp formally noted in December 2014 that the United States had “expressed our support for each of the situations in which ICC investigations and prosecutions are underway.” In particular, the United States welcomed the work of the ICC in all the situation countries in which the Prosecutor was conducting investigations or prosecutions and made specific statements regarding many of these including Kenya, Darfur, Libya, and the DRC. It has also articulated more generalized support for the overall mission of the Court, including for example in the February 2015 U.S. National Security Strategy, which reaffirmed that:

We will work with the international community to prevent and call to account those responsible for the worst human rights abuses, including through support to the International Criminal Court, consistent with U.S. law and our commitment to protecting our personnel. Moreover, we will continue to mobilize allies and partners to strengthen our collective efforts to prevent and respond to mass atrocities using all our instruments of national power.

Most recently, in January 2021 the State Department reaffirmed that “\[t\]he United States shares the goals of the ICC in promoting accountability for the worst crimes known to humanity,” while maintaining its longstanding position that the Court’s jurisdiction should be limited to states that consent or are referred by the Security Council.

For its part, Congress has adopted a number of resolutions commending international justice endeavors and the role of the ICC in specific situations, including the potential investigation by the ICC in South Sudan; an Organization of American States (OAS) review of whether human rights abuses in Venezuela warrant investigation by the ICC; and a potential U.N. referral of those responsible for crimes against humanity committed by the Burmese military against the Rohingya to the ICC.

4. Recent ICC Developments Relevant to its Relationship with the United States

While the relationship between the United States and the ICC has often been in flux, critical recent developments have significantly altered the landscape in which the United States must assess its options for engagement with the Court. The most obvious is the Court’s authorization for the ICC Prosecutor to open an investigation of the situation in Afghanistan, which could encompass the conduct of U.S. personnel (both in Afghanistan and on the territories of other ICC states parties if sufficiently connected with the conflict in Afghanistan). In addition, a Pre-Trial Chamber ruling in February about the Court’s jurisdiction over the “situation in Palestine” has cleared the way for an investigation that might encompass those responsible for settlements policy in the West Bank as well as allegations in connection with violence in Gaza.

There have also been significant progress at the Court regarding other countries that would appear generally aligned with U.S. interests. Besides the Ntaganda and Ongwen judgments, trials are underway against a member of an Islamic militia group for crimes committed in Mali and against two militia leaders in the Central African Republic. The Court has also taken custody of the first suspect from the alliance of government forces and _Janjaweed_ militia responsible for the majority of the atrocities in Darfur, Sudan. Ali Muhammad Ali Abd-Al-Rahman (“Ali Kushayb”) surrendered to authorities in June 2020 and was transferred to the Court soon after. And on January 23, 2021, the Court took custody of Mahamat Said Abdel Kani, a Séléka militia commander alleged to be responsible for crimes against humanity and war crimes in the Central African Republic.

There have been developments in other situations of interest as well. In October 2020, the Prosecutor declined to open an investigation into accusations against United Kingdom forces in Iraq, reasoning that despite the gravity of the alleged crimes, concerns over the investigations, and the fact that no-one was prosecuted, “on the basis of the information available, the Office could not conclude that there was or had been an intent by the UK authorities to shield persons from criminal responsibility.” Meanwhile, at the end of 2020, the Prosecutor stated that she intended to open an investigation into crimes in Ukraine (which would likely include crimes committed by Russian forces and its proxies in Crimea and eastern Ukraine) and in Nigeria (which focuses on crimes committed by Boko Haram and its splinter groups, as well as by Nigerian Security Forces in their conflict with Boko Haram). The Prosecutor is examining a referral from Canada and five South American states (Argentina, Colombia, Chile, Paraguay, and Peru) that are urging the Court to investigate crimes committed by the Maduro regime in Venezuela.

Despite these recent advances, the Court has also experienced a number of setbacks, with just five convictions for core crimes in over 15 years of operation and a substantial number of cases (including high-profile prosecutions of current and formers heads-of-state) being dismissed under circumstances that raise questions about the Prosecution’s investigation and trial strategy (see section XXX, below). The Court’s traditional supporters—sovereign and otherwise—have begun to raise critiques of the Court’s operations and strategic direction that have intensified in recent years, including the expression of concerns that the Court is spreading itself too thin and failing to deliver on its core mandate. This upswell of criticism led states parties in 2019 to institute the Independent Expert Review (IER) process, which is being implemented in parallel with other efforts initiated by member states to address other critical issues in the Court’s relations with states, including proposals that the Court needs to better prioritize the allocation of its limited resources to address the most important situations and cases and potentially reconsider the way in which complementarity operates. Many of these discussions echo concerns that the United States has raised over the years, particularly around the idea that the Court is taking on too much and is not focusing on the most acute situations of international concern.

All of these developments will bear on the next phase of the U.S.-ICC relationship. In particular, the decision to open an investigation of the situation in Afghanistan, and moves towards following suit in Palestine, frame the political context within which the new Administration will need to review its options. At the same time, the IER process creates an opening for U.S. engagement. The remainder of this section will discuss these two situations of concern in greater depth as well as the way in which the IER process intersects with long-standing U.S. concerns vis-à-vis the Court.

1. The “Situation in Afghanistan”

Afghanistan ratified the Rome Statute in 2003. Soon afterwards, the OTP began receiving communications about international crimes being committed in Afghan territory. The OTP commenced a preliminary examination of the situation in Afghanistan in 2006 but did not begin regularly making information public until it began publishing annual reports of its preliminary examinations in 2011. The OTP’s early reports included references to “possibly abusive interrogation techniques” and “abusive techniques such as beatings, electric shocks, sleep deprivation, forced nudity and other forms of ill-treatment” against persons in the custody of international forces (as well as Afghan authorities); however, the references to detainee abuses grew more detailed with time. The early preliminary examination reports also noted allegations that military operations by international forces (including aerial attacks, force protection, search and seizure, and night raid operations) had resulted in civilian casualties, although they also often highlighted the predominance of Taliban responsibility for attacks on civilians and that reports of civilian casualties from the operations of international forces had decreased over time and often reached new lows. Later, the OTP concluded that “the information available does not provide a reasonable basis to believe that the war crime of intentionally directing attacks against the civilian population … has been committed” by forces supporting the Afghan government (including U.S. and other international forces).

Subsequent statements by the Prosecutor suggesting that she would move forward with an investigation generated significant concern within the Obama Administration, but the matter remained under consideration when, shortly after the 2016 election in the United States, the Prosecutor announced that she would decide “imminently” whether to seek an authorization to proceed. The Prosecutor nevertheless did not move forward with an application to the Pre-Trial Chamber—a prerequisite to proceeding in the absence of a state or Security Council referral—until October 2017.

The Prosecutor’s request for authorization focused first on crimes against humanity and war crimes allegedly committed by members of the Taliban (and their affiliated Haqqani Network), with the Prosecutor referring to “50,802 civilian casualties (17,700 deaths and 33,032 injuries) attributed to anti-government armed groups … through attacks often committed with particular cruelty or in order to instill terror and fear among the local civilian population \[and involving\] \[v\]ictims \[who\] were deliberately targeted on a discriminatory basis.” The request next addressed allegations of war crimes by members of the Afghan National Security Forces (“ANSF”), particularly the National Directorate for Security (“NDS”) and the Afghan National Police (“ANP”), with the Prosecutor alleging that such crimes (in particular systematic torture) were committed “on a large scale.”

The crimes alleged to have been committed by Department of Defense (“DOD”) and Central Intelligence Agency (“CIA”) personnel are substantially more limited than those alleged to be committed by the Taliban. Moreover, there are important differences in the Prosecutor’s presentation of allegations against the personnel of these two different agencies.

(i) The Allegations Against DOD Personnel. The Prosecutor’s request for authorization to investigate is based on allegations of torture and other detainee abuse (principally in the period of 2003-2004) and not on allegations regarding combat operations by U.S. armed forces. To the contrary, in seeking authorization to investigate, the Prosecutor determined (on the information available to her at that point) “that there is no reasonable basis to believe that crimes falling within the jurisdiction of the Court were committed during military operations conducted by international military forces in relation” to incidents involving military operations conducted by international military forces that caused civilian casualties.

The scale of the alleged custodial crimes is also much smaller than those alleged against the Taliban and Afghan security forces, with the Prosecutor contending only that there was a reasonable basis to believe at least 78 individuals (54 by U.S. armed forces and 24 by CIA personnel) had been victims of potential war crimes. In contrast to the widespread nature of allegations of detainee mistreatment by Afghan security forces and the systematic nature of the CIA’s “enhanced interrogation” program, the Prosecutor acknowledged in respect of DOD personnel that the alleged mistreatment was “inflicted on a relatively small percentage of all persons detained by US armed forces … \[and\] also appear\[s\] to have occurred during a limited time period, after which the use of all such techniques by US armed forces worldwide was formally rescinded.” And while any failure to adhere to the humane treatment requirements of international humanitarian law is of course serious, the Prosecutor also acknowledged that there was no “headquarters level” policy to approve such abuses, although the Prosecutor alleged that some of the abuses were committed “pursuant to authorized interrogation policies adopted locally.”

(ii) The Allegations Against CIA Personnel. There can be little doubt that the allegations of CIA abuse are serious and deeply troubling. The Prosecutor describes the range of torture and cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment inflicted as part of the CIA’s rendition and enhanced interrogation program in Afghanistan and so-called CIA “black sites” located on the territory of European states, including several that have ratified the Rome Statute (notably Poland, Romania and Lithuania). This includes a list of 13 “techniques” allegedly used individually or in combination and descriptions of their application in certain incidents in detail. And while the number of victims may have been small, the Prosecutor notes that the abuses were not isolated but were the product of a “policy to obtain actionable intelligence.” One need not be politically motivated to consider these crimes as deserving of investigation and accountability.

Following the Prosecutor’s submission of the application to commence an investigation, a Pentagon spokesman stated that an ICC investigation of U.S. personnel would be “unwarranted and unjustified” and that such an investigation would “not serve the interests of either peace or justice in Afghanistan.” In September 2018, then-National Security Adviser Bolton warned that the United States “will use any means necessary to protect our citizens and those of our allies from unjust prosecutions by this illegitimate court,” and threatened a series of measures “if the Court comes after us,” including denial of visas and potential criminal proceedings against ICC officials involved in the investigation or prosecution of Americans. On March 15, 2019, Secretary of State Michael Pompeo announced “a policy of U.S. visa restrictions on those individuals directly responsible for any ICC investigation of U.S. personnel. This includes persons who take or have taken action to request or further such an investigation. These visa restrictions may also be used to deter ICC efforts to pursue allied personnel, including Israelis, without allies’ consent.” There were press reports even before the ICC judges ruled on the Prosecutor’s request for authorization to open an investigation in Afghanistan that the United States did revoke the visa of ICC Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda pursuant to this policy, a development later confirmed by Bensouda.

On April 12, 2019, the Pre-Trial Chamber rejected the Prosecutor’s request for authorization to proceed. While it agreed that “there is reasonable basis to believe the that the incidents underlying the Request have occurred,” that they “may constitute crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court,” and that the alleged crimes were of sufficient gravity, it determined that an investigation in Afghanistan would not be “in the interests of justice” as chances of a successful investigation and prosecution were “extremely limited” (in part because the Prosecutor had been unable to secure cooperation from relevant states, implicitly referring to the United States, and in part because of the “complexity and volatility of the political climate still surrounding the Afghanistan situation”).

President Trump subsequently issued a statement that recalled “the threat \[the Court\] poses to American sovereignty” and vowed that any attempt to target U.S. personnel for prosecution “will be met with a swift and vigorous response.” He called the PTC decision “a major international victory ... for the rule of law,” notwithstanding that the Court had in fact concluded that that there had been a sufficient showing that the crimes had been committed and that they had not been appropriately investigated or prosecuted. Declining to authorize an investigation because of the projected lack of cooperation from states implicated in the alleged crimes was inevitably going to be controversial. But the widespread discomfort with this decision was amplified by the fact that it came in the wake of what was viewed as strident attacks on the Court, and the Trump Administration’s triumphalism, with Secretary Pompeo explicitly linking the Court’s decision not to authorize an investigation with the United States’ imposition of visa restrictions on ICC personnel.

In any event, the Prosecutor promptly appealed. The Appeals Chamber scheduled a three-day hearing for oral arguments, in which it invited interested states, academics, and organizations to participate as _amici_. The United States was not represented, but President Trump’s personal lawyer made an appearance in his capacity as counsel for an NGO, the European Center for Law and Justice. For its part, the Government of Afghanistan contended that it “is determined to secure the rights of the victims of violations of international law and to bring the perpetrators to justice \[and\] is doing everything within its power to investigate and prosecute international crimes committed within its jurisdiction despite the very considerable practical difficulties,” and that in considering the interests of justice the Court should take into account the importance of effective national investigations and prosecutions and the impact of the security situation on the possibility of any effective international investigation.

On March 5, 2020, the Appeals Chamber overturned the Pre-Trial Chamber’s decision. The Appeals Chamber decided that it was not the role of the Pre-Trial Chamber to inquire into the Prosecutor’s analysis of the “interests of justice” question and, indeed, that it was not even the Pre-Trial Chamber’s role to inquire into the OTP’s analysis of complementarity and gravity. On this basis, the Appeals Chamber authorized the Prosecutor to conduct an investigation covering alleged crimes in Afghanistan since May 1, 2003, the date on which Afghanistan became a party to the Rome Statute, as well as “other alleged crimes that have a nexus to the armed conflict in Afghanistan and are sufficiently linked to the situation in Afghanistan and were committed on the territory of other States Parties to the Rome Statute since 1 July 2002.”

Secretary of State Pompeo criticized the decision on the day it was released, stating that the United States “will take all necessary measures to protect our citizens from this renegade, so-called court,” and claiming that the decision was “all the more reckless for this ruling to come just days after the United States signed a historic peace deal on Afghanistan—the best chance for peace in a generation.” Two weeks later, he publicly identified two ICC staffers whom he claimed were “helping drive \[the Prosecutor’s\] effort to use this court to investigate Americans,” and indicated that the next step could be to sanction them “and their family members”—a step critics called an act of “raw intimidation.” On June 11, 2020, President Trump issued an Executive Order in which he determined that ICC investigations in Afghanistan (or involving U.S. allies that were not Rome Statute parties) constituted “an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States” and, on that basis, authorized sanctions (financial and visa restrictions) on any person (including Court officials) designated as having directly engaged in, materially assisted, sponsored, or provided support for, the investigation of U.S. personnel (or of the personnel of any U.S. ally who is not a party to the Court and does not consent).

In a subsequent press event at which he was joined by the Secretary of Defense, the Attorney General, and the National Security Adviser—but not, notably, the Secretary of the Treasury—Secretary Pompeo stated that he was acting consistent with the request of more than 300 members of Congress to support Israel against the ICC, labelled ICC action “a mockery of justice,” attacked the ICC for “botched prosecutions,” and insisted that the United States “cannot allow ICC officials and their families to come to the United States to shop and travel and otherwise enjoy American freedoms as these same officials seek to prosecute the defender of those very freedoms.” Many of these critiques were familiar, but the charges from the Administration officials went further and included assertions that “our adversaries are manipulating the ICC” by encouraging these allegations in a “blatant attempt to subvert justice and the mission of the ICC” (with Attorney General William Barr specifically mentioning Russia) and that the Justice Department had “credible information that raises serious concerns about a long history of financial corruption and malfeasance at the highest levels of the office of the prosecutor.” No details for these allegations were ever publicly articulated; nor were they deemed credible by interlocutors who were briefed by U.S. government sources.

The decision to authorize sanctions was subject to considerable criticism in various quarters in the United States, including by former senior U.S. military commanders, an American Bar Association resolution, and a joint letter from 174 lawyers and legal scholars. A former Treasury Department senior adviser raised concerns that the use of sanctions against the ICC and its officials would “further weaken the once-robust trans-Atlantic bond that has in the past effectively imposed multilateral sanctions against common adversaries, including Russia, terrorists, WMD proliferators, and more.” These steps also prompted numerous other states to reaffirm their support for the ICC (including the United Kingdom, which—as described in section XXX below—had led recent criticism of the Court and calls for its reform). Sixty-seven Rome Statute parties quickly issued a statement calling the ICC an integral part of the “the international rules-based order” and an “essential component of the multilateral architecture upholding the rule-of-law,” and underscored their commitment “to preserve its integrity undeterred by any measures or threats against the Court, its officials, or those cooperating with it.” Four prominent human rights professors who are dual U.S. nationals—and hence potentially exposed to sanctions themselves as well as enforcement actions—filed suit in the Southern District of New York alleging, among other things, that their First Amendment free speech rights were being abridged by the possibility of enforcement action if they provided support to the Prosecutor, even on cases unrelated to the United States. In January 2021, the judge issued a partial temporary injunction enjoining the issuance of sanctions against the plaintiffs. A second lawsuit was filed soon after on behalf of U.S. citizens who risks being penalized for working with the OTP.

_\[TEXT BOX: In a letter following the issuance of the Executive Order authorizing sanctions, 67 states parties to the Rome Statute “reiterate\[d\] our commitment to uphold and defend the principles and values enshrined in the Rome Statute and to preserve its integrity and independence undeterred by any measures or threats against the Court, its officials and those cooperating with it. We note that sanctions are a tool to be used against those responsible for the most serious crimes, not against those seeking justice. Any attempt to undermine the independence of the Court should not be tolerated._

_The International Criminal Court embodies our collective commitment to fight impunity for the most serious crimes under international law. By giving our full support to the Court and promoting its universal membership, we defend the progress we have made together towards an international rules-based order, of which international justice is an indispensable pillar.”\]_

On September 3, 2020, the Secretary Pompeo announced the first sanctions under this Executive Order against ICC Prosecutor Bensouda and Phakiso Mochochoko, the head of the Prosecution’s Jurisdiction, Complementarity and Cooperation Division. International reaction was again sharply negative, with many arguing that this approach was counter-productive, undermines the effectiveness of U.S. arguments on the merits, alienates our allies, shifts the international debate away from the ICC’s deficits to the extreme U.S. reaction, and erodes the ability of U.S. friends to argue in favor of reforms that would be in the U.S. interest. European Union High Representative Josep Borrell decried the measures as “unacceptable and unprecedented” and pledged that Europeans would “resolutely defend \[the Court\] from any attempts aimed at obstructing the course of justice.” A former State Department Sanctions Coordinator argued that “\[i\]t creates the reality, not just the impression, of the United States as a unilateralist bully with contempt for international law and norms.”

In an op-ed in _Foreign Policy_ magazine, General Wesley Clark called the move a “tragic mistake” that put the United States in the company of “rogue states like the Philippines and Burundi which have threatened United Nations investigators and prosecutors.” Said General Clark:

Attacking international bodies like the ICC may feel like a cost-free way to score political points. But just as Americans benefit from the work of the World Health Organization and other multilateral institutions the Trump administration has turned against, the existence of tribunals to help enforce international law is an asset to U.S. security. Americans should continue to protect U.S. service members with a firm commitment to international law. And when Americans’ actions are scrutinized, the U.S. government should have the confidence to react in a way that preserves the benefits of these institutions, protects U.S. personnel, and does justice to American values.

For its part, the Government of Afghanistan took its own steps to respond to the opening of the investigation. On March 26, 2020, the government submitted a request under Article 18(2) of the Rome Statute for a deferral of the investigation, saying that it “is investigating or has investigated its nationals or others within its jurisdiction with respect to criminal acts allegedly committed within the authorised parameters of the Situation in Afghanistan.” The OTP subsequently announced that, in view of its ongoing assessment of the request, in addition to practical restrictions owing to the global health crisis, the Prosecutor is not currently undertaking investigative activities in or about Afghanistan. As at the time of writing, there is no information on the ICC website indicating that any further steps have been taken.

2. The “Situation in Palestine”

The proposed investigation of the situation in Palestine would encompass allegations of war crimes by Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups (and potentially Israeli Defense Forces) in connection with the 2014 conflict in the Gaza Strip but also allegations against senior Israeli officials related to Israel’s settlement policies in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. This last set of allegations is the most contentious as it involves official Israeli policy, making it difficult to argue that the conduct has been or is being investigated within the Israeli judicial system.

The jurisdictional questions over these issues first arose for the OTP in 2009 when the Palestinians submitted a declaration under Article 12(3) that purported to accept the Court’s jurisdiction. Then-Prosecutor Luis Moreno Ocampo kept the matter under review for several years but eventually concluded that the ICC lacked jurisdiction. This was based not on an independent assessment of whether Palestine was a state, but rather invoked the competence of the U.N. Secretary-General as the treaty depository, “who, in case of doubt, will defer to the guidance of the General Assembly.” Given that the General Assembly (and thus the Secretary General) did not treat Palestine as a state at that point, the Prosecutor likewise concluded that the Palestinians could not confer jurisdiction on the Court.

The situation changed when the General Assembly decided in Resolution 67/19 November 29, 2012) to accord the Palestinians “non-member observer state status in the United Nations.” When the Palestinians then submitted another Article 12(3) declaration (as well as their instrument purportedly acceding to the treaty) in January 2015, the current Prosecutor took the position that, effective from the date of Resolution 67/19, the Palestinians were able to accept the Court’s jurisdiction, and she opened a preliminary examination on January 16. The Prosecutor eventually concluded that there was reasonable basis to proceed and that (because the Palestinians had referred the situation) there was no need to secure authorization from a Pre-Trial Chamber in order to commence an investigation. Nevertheless, on December 20, 2019, the Prosecutor—citing “the unique history and circumstances of the Occupied Palestinian Territory” which means that any “determination of the Court’s jurisdiction may … touch on complex legal and factual issues”—requested a jurisdictional ruling to confirm “that the ‘territory’ over which the Court may exercise its jurisdiction ... comprises … the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and Gaza.”

Faced with this question, the Court solicited _amicus_ briefs from States, organizations, and persons wishing to provide their views. Israel chose not to formally submit a brief, but its Attorney General made available a “white paper” setting out Israeli views in considerable detail, which the Prosecutor brought to the attention of the Court. For its part, the United States did not avail itself of the opportunity to participate as an _amicus_, but the two most recent former heads of the State Department’s Office of Global Criminal Justice submitted an extensive brief that supported Israel’s position and questioned the logic underlying the Prosecutor’s conclusion that Palestine qualified as a state.

On February 5, 2021, the Pre-Trial Chamber issued its decision by a vote of 2-1. Among other things, it concluded that Palestine was a “State Party to the Statute,” that its accession provided a basis for the Court to exercise jurisdiction, and that the area over which the Court could exercise jurisdiction encompassed the “territories occupied by Israel since 1967, namely Gaza and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem.” The United States responded by noting that “we do not believe the Palestinians qualify as a sovereign state, and therefore are not qualified to obtain membership as a state, or participate as a state in international organizations, entities, or conferences, including the ICC. We have serious concerns about the ICC’s attempts to exercise its jurisdiction over Israeli personnel. The United States has always taken the position that the court’s jurisdiction should be reserved for countries that consent to it, or that are referred by the UN Security Council.” \[Reference to additional reactions to ruling\].

For its part, Congress has passed a number of restrictions in annual appropriations legislation related to these Palestinian efforts to involve the ICC, though in each case the target of the legislation has been the Palestinians rather than the Court itself. The current year version of the legislation contains restrictions on the eligibility of the Palestinian Authority for assistance under the Economic Support Fund, as well as restrictions on the Palestinians’ ability to maintain the PLO office in Washington unless the President certifies that the Palestinians have not “initiated or actively supported an ICC investigation against Israeli national for alleged crimes against Palestinians.” Indeed, it was in connection with this latter piece of legislation that the previous Administration announced the closure of the PLO office in September 2018.

More recently, a number of letters, signed by a significant number of members, expressed various levels of concern about, and opposition to, ICC action against Israel. For example, a May 13, 2020, letter from Senators Cardin and Portman “urge\[d\] \[Secretary Pompeo\] to continue \[his\] vigorous support of Israel as it faces the growing possibility of investigations and prosecutions by the International Criminal Court,” while also noting that the authors “support the ICC’s stated goal of ensuring accountability for the gravest crimes of concern to the international community.” In his June 2020 remarks, Secretary Pompeo justified the threat of sanctions with the fact that he was “gravely concerned about the threat the court poses to Israel.” Secretary Pompeo noted that “\[m\]ore than 300 members of Congress—Republicans and Democrats alike—recently sent me letters asking that the United States support Israel in the face of the ICC’s lawless, politicized attacks.” However, a number of members of Congress subsequently issued public statements criticizing the announcement of President Trump’s Executive Order and the sanctions under it, with one Senator who had signed the letter calling the sanctions “misguided and counterproductive,” and others calling the sanctions “a slap in the face to victims of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide the world over \[that\] will surely be condemned by our law-abiding democratic allies.”

Although it is anticipated that any investigation by the Prosecutor into these matters will be on a slow trajectory, there is no question that the U.S. relationship with the ICC will be influenced by the degree to which members of Congress, and the U.S. public, decide to raise concerns about progress before the Court.

3. ICC Performance, Review, and Potential Reforms

Critics of the ICC have long questioned the extent to which the institution has lived up to its ideals. These criticisms have intensified in recent years as the ICC has amassed a record that can be described as mixed, at best. States, commentators, and the Independent Expert Review have identified a range of causal factors and potential solutions. To a certain degree, some of these solutions could implicate issues that have already been the subject of ICC jurisprudence, which may need to be revisited; others, however, may be addressed through other means, including the exercise of sound prosecutorial discretion or rules changes.

For its part , the OTP has achieved just five convictions for core crimes in the 15 years since the first arrest warrants were issued. A number of other prosecutions have resulted in dismissals or controversial acquittals suggesting problems with the OTP’s investigative methods and generating academic criticism of the judicial reasoning. This has included the high-profile termination of the two cases against Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta and Vice President William Ruto, the dismissal of the case mid-trial against former Côte d’Ivoire President Laurent Gbagbo and an associate on a no case to answer motion, and the dramatic acquittal on appeal of former DRC Vice President Jean-Pierre Bemba. This record has led numerous states and commentators to criticize the OTP for investigations that are both too broad and too shallow, for litigating cases only against the most senior leaders without adequately laying the foundation for those cases by “building up” from investigations and convictions of lower level perpetrators, for not spending sufficient time in country or developing situation-specific expertise, and failing to secure sufficient concrete evidence to link those senior leaders to the crimes committed. At the same time, others have pointed out that the impact of the institution should not be measured by convictions alone, and that the Court also stands to make significant contributions through catalyzation of domestic accountability processes, its enunciation of jurisprudential norms, its interactions with affected communities and empowerment of civil society justice advocates, and deterrence.

Concerns regarding the working methods of the Office of the Prosecutor are not limited to the outcomes of specific cases. An early focus on African situations generated complaints that the OTP was “targeting” African suspects. Several states threatened to withdraw from the Rome Statute after coming under scrutiny, although only two (Burundi and the Philippines) have followed through. The large number of situations that the Prosecutor is investigating or that are under preliminary examination, as well as the length of time taken by the Prosecutor before concluding her preliminary examinations, has also drawn criticism. Specifically, the Prosecutor currently has investigations ongoing in 13 situations, including Afghanistan, the DRC, Northern Uganda, Darfur, two separate investigations in the Central African Republic, Kenya, Libya, Côte d’Ivoire, Mali, Georgia, Burundi, and Bangladesh / Myanmar. At the same time, the Prosecutor’s latest report indicates that she is conducting substantive (Phase 2 and 3) preliminary examinations in six situations, and has recently concluded that the criteria for commencing an investigation had been met to open new investigations in a further three (Ukraine, Nigeria, and Palestine). The existence of such a large number of ongoing prosecutions, investigations, and preliminary examinations in multiple regions of the world has led to criticism that the OTP is simply spread too thin. It also calls into question whether conducting simultaneous investigations in so many situations is consistent with the Court’s mandate to focus on “the most serious crimes of concern to the international community as a whole.”

For her part, the Prosecutor has acknowledged the imbalance between the scope of the situations on which the OTP is working and the availability of resources to conduct this work, stating in December 2020 that “in the immediate period ahead, we will need to take several strategic and operational decisions on the prioritisation of the Office’s workload.” Indeed, as a result of this, the Prosecutor indicated that she will not yet take steps to open investigations in Ukraine and Nigeria until she has consulted with the incoming Prosecutor “on the strategic and operational issues related to the prioritisation of the Office’s workload.” The Prosecutor is also seeking input on criteria for closing investigations. Remarkably, despite concerns over how thinly resources are spread, and how long the Prosecutor takes to conduct preliminary examinations, no investigation has yet been formally closed in the sixteen years since the OTP opened its first investigation in 2004, although some investigations technically remain open despite a lack of active investigatory measures and a number of preliminary examinations have concluded with a decision not to proceed.

Criticism has not been limited to the Office of the Prosecutor. The quality of the judicial reasoning has varied considerably, and the Court has issued a number of fractured opinions that suggest a high degree of institutional discord. Questions have been raised about the independence, collegiality, and professionalism of some of the judges, including an attempt by one judge to continue sitting in a trial while she simultaneously took up a post as Ambassador to a third state; litigation by some of the judges against the Court seeking increased salaries notwithstanding a zero growth budget; statements by a judge that suggested he would ignore a procedural rule with which he disagreed; and criticism by judges of the quality of their brethren’s judicial reasoning. Meanwhile, the capacity of the Registry to appropriately manage victim participation, witness intimidation, and the frozen assets of suspects has been questioned.

Against this backdrop, the United Kingdom delivered a strongly-worded intervention at the 2018 Assembly of States Parties, stating bluntly that the Court has fallen short of expectations and that “we cannot bury our heads in the sand and pretend everything is fine when it isn’t.” Over the following year, more traditional supporters of the Court voiced similar concerns. In April 2019, the four former Presidents of the ICC Assembly of States Parties issued a critical letter that lamented the “growing gap between the unique vision captured in the Rome Statute … and some of the daily work of the Court,” and stated that the authors were “disappointed by the quality of some of its judicial proceedings, frustrated by some of the results, and exasperated by the management deficiencies.” The four former Presidents concluded that it was time to “make a new deal between the ICC and its states parties” and called for “an independent assessment of the Court’s functioning.”

ICC states parties heeded this call by commissioning an Independent Expert Review (IER) to be carried out by a group of nine eminent experts chaired by Justice Richard Goldstone. The Independent Experts issued an extensive report in September 2020 containing searching critiques of how the Court has functioned and putting forward 384 recommendations aimed at states parties and all organs of the Court. The Report catalogues a range of observations, including about the Court’s workplace culture (referring to fear, bullying, and harassment among the staff), organizational structure, the quality and consistency of judicial reasoning, and the lack of strategic planning. Critically, the Report notes that

concern has been rising regarding the way in which the OTP handles the high volume of potential situations and cases, taking into account its limited resources … with regard to the selection or prioritisation of situations and cases, there is insufficient consideration given to the prospects of investigative and prosecutorial success. … Likewise, there is concern that the threshold of sufficient gravity is pitched too low. Furthermore, the Experts observed a lack of long-term planning for the life-cycle of PEs \[preliminary examinations\] and investigations, including their (de-)prioritisation and eventual closure.

The Experts proposed that the OTP investigate fewer situations, given that “the current situation is unsustainable,” by raising the threshold of gravity in her operations. The Experts also emphasized the need to prioritize between investigations, given the limited resources, and to prepare guidelines (in consultations with states) about when and on what basis the OTP would de-prioritize, hibernate, or close investigations.

In establishing the mandate of the IER, states had requested that the Assembly of States Parties (rather than the Independent Experts) address a handful of issues pertaining directly to the relationship between state parties and the Court, including “\[c\]omplementarity, and the relationship between national jurisdictions and the Court.” Through these discussions, states parties are pursuing a number of streams of work, including dialogue with the OTP on its existing and forthcoming policy papers on complementarity and completion strategies; “a possible ASP or States Parties’ statement or resolution on complementarity;”; and developing “the structural role of the ASP as a forum for dialogue and cooperation on complementarity issues between the Court” and others, including non-party states.

Meanwhile, states (and the Court) are also continuing discussions of how to implement the recommendations of the IER Report. These discussions reflect a greater openness by states (and to some extent the Court itself) to consider critiques that might in previous years have been reflexively rejected: that the Court is currently trying to do too much; that it needs to focus more on its core mandate of addressing the most serious crimes of concern to the international community as a whole; that it should apply a higher threshold of gravity; that it should conduct deeper investigations into a smaller number of situations; that it should take a more strategic approach to the cases that it selects within situations and should “hibernate” investigations that show low prospects for success; and that the Court should give greater deference to good-faith, even if imperfect, efforts to pursue accountability under domestic law, particularly when it comes to non-party states. States are also exploring a range of ways to signal to the Court their expectations and the ways in which it should revise its working methods, including ASP resolutions, interpretative guidance, and amendments to the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.

The increased openness to these kinds of discussions presents a clear opportunity for the United States to influence the manner in which states and the Court think about key issue that affect U.S. interests. Many of our consultations affirmed that states would welcome constructive engagement by the United States. The fact that a new Prosecutor—Karim Khan, a British barrister with extensive experience in international criminal proceedings who currently serves as Special Adviser and Head of UNITAD—was elected in February 2021 and will be assuming office in June underscores that this is an opportune moment to review, and provide input on, existing Prosecutorial policies, strategies, and decisions on which investigations or cases to prioritize with the Office’s limited resources. If nothing else, the new Prosecutor may be more willing to revisit past decisions with a fresh eye if provided with persuasive arguments or compelling evidence of the wisdom of reconsidering prior approaches.

5. U.S. Interests Impacted by the ICC

The ICC implicates a range of U.S. foreign policy interests—both regional and functional. For example, the United States has manifested—in word and deed—longstanding, deep, and bipartisan commitments to atrocity prevention, accountability for international crimes, and support for the rule of law. These priorities suggest the merits of normalizing the U.S. relationship with the Court and thereby enhancing the ability of the United States to provide assistance to ongoing investigations in situation countries where the ICC presents the most promising, or in some cases only, option for providing some measure of accountability. Indeed, there are circumstances in which the Security Council has referred a matter for the Court, or where the Court is working in partnership with the territorial/nationality state, that do not trigger the traditional U.S. concerns about the ICC, and where ICC involvement would indeed further U.S. interests.

At the same time, recent activities by the Court in the situations in Afghanistan and Palestine have shone a spotlight on the potential for the Court to conflict with other U.S. interests. The opening of an investigation into the situation in Afghanistan has cast in sharper relief longstanding U.S. concerns to avoid any exercise of international or foreign jurisdiction over its servicemembers or officials. And the potential investigation of Israeli officials in connection with the situation in Palestine raises concerns over both the ICC exercising jurisdictions nationals of non-party states (in this case a close U.S. ally) and the potential for the ICC to impede the peaceful resolution of longstanding conflicts (including by judicializing the resolution of matters such as the fate of settlements in the West Bank, which the U.S. has long insisted must be negotiated between the parties). These areas of more acute concern could overshadow more diffuse U.S. commitments to justice and accountability. Recommending a course of action that will achieve the optimal balance between these affirmative and defensive equities is the major challenge faced by this Task Force.

To map this path forward, this section identifies the universe of interests implicated by the U.S. relationship with the Court—both those where the ICC’s efforts may be in tension with U.S. interests (defensive) and those where it may be more aligned (affirmative). The history of U.S. leadership on international justice grew out of a number of deeply held values that are aligned with the underlying mission of the ICC and many of its activities, as discussed below. Any U.S. policy going forward should seek the optimal expression of these interests, but balance them in a way that defensive concerns do not undermine the United States ability to articulate, and advance, its long-standing commitment to the project of international justice. Although the ICC occupies an important place in this system, it is not the only forum in which efforts toward justice and accountability are underway. As such, any U.S. approach should continue to seek the most effective options to address the commission of international crimes, bring justice to victims, and promote the principle that those responsible for atrocities should be held to account.

1. Jurisdiction over U.S. Personnel

As described above, U.S. policymakers in both Republican and Democratic administrations have emphasized their desire to protect U.S. personnel from the jurisdiction of the ICC. Such concerns about subjecting U.S. personnel to non-U.S. jurisdiction pre-date the promulgation of the Rome Statute. Indeed, they figured prominently in the ratification debates regarding the NATO Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) in the early 1950s as well as subsequent bilateral SOFAs modelled on it. The NATO SOFA provides for a system of shared jurisdiction between “sending” and “receiving” states when it comes to the U.S. military forces who would, for the first time, be stationed on the territory of our European allies following World War II. When the NATO SOFA was submitted to the Senate for its advice and consent, strong criticism emerged that the United States was seeming to allow the exercise of foreign criminal jurisdiction over U.S. personnel deployed abroad, and there were calls—ultimately unsuccessful—to issue a reservation to the treaty under which U.S. military authorities would retain exclusive jurisdiction over their personnel stationed abroad.

Although the Senate eventually provided its advice and consent to the NATO SOFA, the Defense Department and the U.S. Government have ever since highlighted the importance of maximizing legal protection for U.S. forces serving overseas. While events can sometimes supervene, longstanding U.S. policy has been “not to send military personnel to a foreign country without satisfactory status protections.” The traditional rationales in support of the need for such legal protections include the importance of: ensuring that the individuals required under military orders to serve in foreign locations enjoy the full range of constitutional due process rights, enforcing U.S. military discipline through the chain of command and within the U.S. military justice system, and reassuring servicemembers that their commanders’ orders, and their consistency with international humanitarian law, will not be reviewed or second-guessed by external authorities outside of the chain of command. This stance is also based on U.S. confidence in the integrity of its judicial system—both military and civilian.

The United States has sought to work within the Rome Statute to protect its personnel from ICC jurisdiction. By its terms, Article 98(2) of the Rome Statute contemplates agreements that would prevent the Court from seeking the surrender of a person to the ICC if doing so would put it in violation of competing legal obligations under a SOFA. Under the Bush Administration, the United States thus sought free-standing Article 98 agreements with a number of states and language in Security Council resolutions exempting the personnel of non-member states contributing to peacekeeping missions from ICC jurisdiction in order to minimize the risk that the ICC could obtain jurisdiction over U.S. personnel.

With this same goal in mind, the United States has long objected to the ICC’s assertion of jurisdiction over nationals of states that are not parties to the Rome Statute (at least absent consent by that state or a referral by the Security Council). The 2009 ASIL Task Force Report examined the legal arguments that the jurisdiction of the Court over non-party nationals in the circumstances prescribed in the Statute was inconsistent with international law and considered them to be unfounded. Likewise, U.S. friends and allies have been virtually uniform in declining to support the arguments.

That said, concerns about the exposure of U.S. servicemembers to possible ICC jurisdiction continue to have great political resonance. Thus, when Secretary Pompeo announced the designation of the ICC Prosecutor and her staffer on June 11, he framed the threat to the sovereignty posed to the United States by the ICC by beginning his remarks as follows—

Imagine an American soldier, sailor, airman, Marine, or an intelligence officer is on leave with his or her family, maybe on a beach in Europe. And over the course of two decades or more, this soldier honorably defended America in Anbar Province, in Kandahar, taking down terrorists. Then suddenly, that vacation turns into a nightmare. The European country’s national police takes that soldier into custody, detaining him or her on politically motivated charges. A prison sentence abroad is a distinct possibility. A spouse behind bars for defending freedom. A son or daughter robbed of their mom or dad, all on the initiative of some prosecutor in the Netherlands.

In reality, nothing the OTP is doing in Afghanistan and nothing the ICC has done in other cases suggests that this is a realistic scenario. Nevertheless, concern about possible jurisdiction over servicemen and servicewomen, on the one hand, and leaders, on the other, both play a role in shaping U.S. concerns, but the issues raised by the two sets of concern have important differences. It thus appears virtually inevitable that U.S. policymakers will continue to give high priority to perceived needs both to protect all U.S. personnel from the possibility of ICC investigation and prosecution.

It is worth noting that the risk of a non-U.S. tribunal asserting jurisdiction against U.S. personnel is not unique to the ICC. For example, during the 1999 Kosovo War, the ICTY Prosecutor examined the conduct of the U.S. military in determining whether charges should be brought against any U.S. personnel in connection with the NATO bombing campaign in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia as part of Operation Allied Force. As General Clark has noted, “\[t\]his kind of scrutiny is uncomfortable, especially when it touches on acts under one’s own command, but the United States’ commitment to complying with the law, its reliance on professional legal guidance, and the rigor of the U.S. justice system give Americans the tools to manage it.” It is similarly significant that the United States faces comparable risks in foreign domestic courts, and foreign states have occasionally exercised jurisdiction over U.S. personnel for conduct that they allege to be criminal. In most cases, the United States has successfully addressed such situations diplomatically, including by invoking the principle of complementarity and demonstrating adequate domestic proceedings. One difference with these other scenarios turns on the nature of the ICC. For example, in the early 2000s, when efforts were initiated to bring war crimes charges against Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld under universal jurisdiction legislation in Belgium, the United States pressed strongly in diplomatic channels—including through threats that it would push to have NATO headquarters moved to another country—to have the case withdrawn. The Belgian government ultimately amended its universal jurisdiction law, making it more difficult to bring such charges absent a tighter nexus to Belgium. By design, the ICC is structured to insulate against states resorting to that type of recourse.

2. Peace Negotiations and Conflict Resolution

There have been concerns that criminal investigations and prosecutions by international tribunals may in some contexts complicate diplomatic efforts to resolve ongoing conflicts, including because of fears that leaders may be less likely to compromise or relinquish power if they anticipate that doing so could lead to criminal prosecution for their past conduct. Placing the power to investigate and prosecute in the hands of an international institution—particularly one that makes decisions based solely on ostensibly legal factors, rather than considering the larger political aspects of any negotiated settlement—can limit options for international negotiators and local communities trying to break cycles of violence or implement non-penal transitional justice programs.

For example, in the period following the statement in the Prosecutor’s annual report on preliminary examinations that a decision on whether to pursue an investigation in Afghanistan was imminent, the Afghan government argued that, by moving forward with an investigation, the OTP could harm the then-ongoing peace process with Hezb-e Islami and its leader, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar. Hekmatyar was implicated in heinous war crimes, yet he and other Hezb commanders and fighters had been offered a blanket amnesty as part of the negotiations for joining the peace process (with Hekmatyar’s name having been removed from the U.N. sanctions list and formally welcomed to the Presidential palace). Indeed, a condition of the peace talks with the Taliban that were conducted following agreement with the United States in February 2020 was the release of up to 5,000 Taliban prisoners. This strongly suggests a tolerance for some measure of impunity to bring over forty years of conflict in Afghanistan to a close that is in tension with the Rome Statute principle that atrocity crimes “must not go unpunished.” Yet the international community has strongly supported this effort at peacemaking. Indeed, the _communiqué_ adhered to by participants from 66 countries and 32 international organizations in connection with the Afghanistan Conference in Geneva in November 2020 welcomed developments in the peace process with no mention of the need for investigation or prosecution of those responsible for the war crimes that have been endemic in Afghanistan or of any need for Afghanistan to cooperate with the ICC.

The Rome Statute includes two provisions that could be invoked to help manage clashes between potential ICC investigations or prosecutions and the imperative of negotiating durable resolutions of conflicts around the globe. First, the Rome Statute authorizes the ICC Prosecutor to consider whether she should decline to proceed with an investigation or prosecution because such an investigation or prosecution would not be in the “interests of justice.” Second, the Security Council is empowered by Article 16 to defer any investigation or prosecution for 12 months (renewable) by a resolution adopted under Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter on the premise that such a deferral would contribute to international peace and security. While they provide mechanisms to manage a conflict between the perceived interests of peace and justice, neither of these provisions fully addresses the concern (especially as applied to date).

With respect to the “interests of justice,” an early Office of the Prosecutor policy paper interpreted the phrase in a way that vastly limits—some might say eliminates—the extent to which political considerations, including non-penal transitional justice mechanisms, can be taken into account in a decision by the Prosecutor not to proceed with an investigation or prosecution. Even if such factors could be taken into account, however, there would be no assurance that the Prosecutor would assess the risk to political negotiations in the same way as those involved in the negotiations, and no _a priori_ reason to believe that the OTP’s assessment would be more accurate. That said, the Prosecutor has substantial discretion here and the relevant policy paper could be withdrawn or amended by the incoming Prosecutor. With respect to Article 16 deferrals, the fact that any of the permanent members of the Security Council could block a deferral means that those involved in negotiations cannot count on the Council taking the action that they consider necessary. Moreover, the fact that the Rome Statute contemplates such deferrals for periods of no more than twelve months at a time would make it even harder to assure the relevant parties that they could rely on the Council taking future action each year.

To be sure, many ICC supporters and scholars argue that criminal accountability is, in fact, a necessary ingredient for achieving durable peace settlements; and General Clark recounts that he “witnessed firsthand how the U.N.’s Yugoslavia tribunal helped end the conflict in Kosovo and drive Slobodan Milosevic and other abusive leaders from power.” The point here is not to decide which side of this debate has the better argument, only to show that this is an issue that can be of understandable concern to policymakers.

3. The Prevention of Atrocities

The U.S. Government, under both Democratic and Republican administrations, has recognized a strong interest in the prevention of mass atrocities. This is driven in part by long-standing U.S. principles and values, including a deep-seated consensus formed following the Holocaust that genocide and the deliberate targeting of civilians cannot be tolerated. In addition to these moral considerations, there is also widespread recognition that mass atrocities can threaten international peace and security in a number of ways, including by destabilizing entire regions through conflict diffusion; generating uncontrolled migration, internal displacement, and refugee flows; emboldening perpetrators and creating openings for violent extremism to flourish; creating grievances that extremists can exploit; disrupting economic relations and undermining progress on economic development; contributing to state fragility; necessitating costly _ex post_ interventions; and undermining the credibility of international norms, especially when the international community is perceived to be standing idly by while violence unfolds. In creating an interagency Atrocities Prevention Board (APB), President Obama was the first U.S. President to link the moral obligation to prevent harm with the national interests inherent to doing so when he announced: “preventing mass atrocities and genocide is a core national security interest and a core moral responsibility of the United States.” All told, it is axiomatic that it is “morally, politically, financially, and prudentially better to prevent atrocity crimes than to react to stop them once under way.”

The interest in atrocity prevention has also been strongly tied to an emphasis on the importance of accountability for perpetrators. For example, President Obama’s National Security Strategy stated:

The mass killing of civilians is an affront to our common humanity and a threat to our common security. It destabilizes countries and regions, pushes refugees across borders, and creates grievances that extremists exploit. We have a strong interest in leading an international response to genocide and mass atrocities when they arise, recognizing options are more extensive and less costly when we act preventively before situations reach crisis proportions. We know the risk of mass atrocities escalates when citizens are denied basic rights and freedoms, are unable to hold accountable the institutions of government, or face unrelenting poverty and conflict. ... We will work with the international community to prevent and call to account those responsible for the worst human rights abuses, including through support to the International Criminal Court, consistent with U.S. law and our commitment to protecting our personnel.

Though lacking the specific reference to the ICC, the Bush and Trump Administrations also underscored their commitment to this set of interests. In President Trump’s 2017 National Security Strategy, for example, one of the “Priority Actions” under “Champion American Values” was the commitment that “\[w\]e will hold perpetrators of genocide and mass atrocities accountable.” These statements of principle have been backed with resources. In 2020, the executive branch reported to Congress that in “Fiscal Year 2019, State and \[the US Agency for International Development (USAID)\] allocated approximately $10.5 million towards atrocity prevention programming globally.”

Nonetheless, when faced with unfolding violence, the international community often mobilizes too late when opportunities for lower cost actions have been missed and more robust interventions are required. Indeed, the commission of war crimes and crimes against humanity in the former Yugoslavia drew the United States into extended military and peacekeeping commitments. And the prolonged conflicts and associated atrocities in Syria and Northern Iraq prompted similar deployments of U.S. forces to counter, and reduce the space for, terrorist groups that emerged out of the instability and governance vacuum.

Congress too has underscored the importance of atrocity prevention and response. For example, the 2018 Elie Wiesel Genocide and Atrocity Prevention Act institutionalized the process of interagency coordination first instantiated within the APB and continued by President Trump’s Atrocity Early Warning Task Force, and specifically highlighted criminal accountability for past atrocities as a necessary component of a government-wide strategy to identify, prevent, and respond to the risk of atrocities. Enacted in December 2019, the Global Fragility Act mandates a similar coordinated approach across government to address the wider problems of instability and state fragility that frequently establish the preconditions for mass violence and atrocity. And the FY2021 National Defense Authorization Act includes language that requires the State Department, in coordination with DOD and USAID, to incorporate the prevention of atrocities and the mitigation of fragility into security assistance and cooperation planning and implementation and to ensure that the Department of State’s Atrocity Assessment Framework is factored into the Integrated Country Strategy and the Country Development Cooperation Strategy for countries at risk of mass atrocities.

Whatever one may think of the effectiveness of the ICC in practice when it comes to promoting deterrence and reconciliation—and the literature is mixed—the Rome Statute embodies these same ideals. Its preamble poignantly invokes the memory of past atrocities, the threat that such atrocities pose to security and stability, and a determination that ending impunity for atrocities will “contribute to the prevention of such crimes.” The deep concerns about the importance of preventing atrocities, but prosecuting those responsible when this proves impossible, are shared by the United States and are among long-standing U.S. foreign policy priorities.

4. Accountability for International Crimes

As with its bipartisan dedication to atrocity prevention, the U.S. commitment to accountability for those responsible for atrocity crimes has long been seen as a matter of both promoting U.S. values and advancing national security interests. Indeed, the promotion of accountability has been consistently embodied within United States’ National Security Strategies and endorsed in congressional resolutions. As noted above, this commitment is not just rhetorical: the United States has long been a strong supporter of international justice mechanisms. From Nuremberg and Tokyo, to the _ad hoc_ International Criminal Tribunals for the Former Yugoslavia and for Rwanda, to a range of hybrid courts and tribunals convened to address other atrocity crimes, to the newest generation of investigative mechanisms, to non-governmental organizations dedicated to the careful documentation of international crimes, the United States has been instrumental in creating and providing financial and other forms of in-kind support to these entities.

The U.S. commitment to accountability for international crimes extends beyond its support for the establishment and operation of specific justice mechanisms and is reflected in a range of steps that prioritize justice and accountability for international crimes in its foreign relations. It has also invested significantly in countries wracked by violence in multiple ways, including by conducting empirical fieldwork on genocide in Darfur and against the Rohingya; deploying special forces to help track the Lord’s Resistance Army in Northern Uganda and _environs_; funding mobile courts and legal clinics in Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo to prosecute sexual and gender-based crimes; and establishing peacekeeping missions with robust civilian protection and justice components. The first report under the Elie Wiesel Act further notes that:

The United States Government uses foreign assistance as a critical tool to prevent, mitigate, and respond to atrocities. The Department of State and USAID fund atrocity prevention programs globally. The Department of State’s programming includes … documenting and preserving evidence of human rights violations and abuses to bolster current and future efforts to pursue truth, justice, and accountability. Department of State programming also funds efforts to increase the capacity of criminal-justice institutions and actors to mitigate violence and hold perpetrators accountable. … USAID integrates atrocity prevention into programs that advance the rule of law and human rights.

Recent legislation underscores the bipartisan commitment to accountability, including the Women, Peace, and Security Act of 2017, which mandates the full inclusion of women’s experiences in designing and implementing transitional justice and accountability efforts; the Syrian War Crime Accountability Act of 2017 (incorporated into the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019), which mandates reporting and technical assistance around transitional justice and accountability in Syria; the Iraq & Syria Genocide Accountability Act of 2018, which mandates a range of assistance to justice efforts, including training in war crimes investigations and the collection of evidence; and the Caesar Syrian Civilian Protection Act of 2019, which amplified the Syrian sanctions.

During the Clinton administration, the United States created an unprecedented post of Ambassador-at-Large for Global Criminal Justice (previously for War Crimes Issues), and a functional office dedicated to liaising with international justice efforts and promoting transitional justice in states emerging from repression or armed conflict. The United States has invested substantial resources to hold accountable those who commit atrocity crimes. Among other initiatives, the United States created the War Crimes Rewards Program, offering substantial rewards (up to $5 million) for information leading to the arrest, transfer, or conviction of designated individuals accused of crimes against humanity, genocide, or war crimes. Most recently, the 2021 Consolidated Appropriations Act underscored the importance of accountability by committing not less that US $10 million to the Office of Global Criminal Justice for “programs to promote accountability for genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes.” And, the United States has implemented numerous other measures to encourage accountability for violations of international crimes, including a suite of international crimes statutes, the Torture Victims’ Protection Act, human rights exceptions to state immunity within the Foreign Sovereign Immunity Act, and the issuance of sanctions for serious human rights abuses under the Global Magnitsky Act and EO 13818.

This litany of U.S. initiatives reveals a considerable investment by the United States in international justice efforts. In this regard, the ICC is an institution that is devoted to the same end, whose mission is aligned with U.S. values and interests. The role of the ICC in providing some measure of justice and accountability for communities that have been victimized by the most serious atrocity crimes has been specifically highlighted by the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), which recommended in 2015 that the U.S. Government support the referral of the situations in Iraq and Syria to the ICC, and in 2020 that the U.S. Government “cooperate with and support efforts to collect, preserve, and analyze evidence of the international crimes committed against the Rohingya” and “support for these legal processes” which include the ICC investigation. The ICC’s investigations are also frequently focused on countries where justice is a high priority for the United States. As discussed above, the ICC concluded its first trial against a commander of the Lord’s Resistance Army and secured custody of the first government-backed militia leader charged with atrocities in Darfur—both situations in which the United States has invested heavily in peace and accountability. Multiple U.S. allies in the Western hemisphere referred the situation in Venezuela to the ICC, calling on it to investigate the Maduro regime for abuses committed against its own population and mirroring U.S. calls for accountability for perpetrators within this illegitimate regime. And the ICC Prosecutor has announced that she intends to open an investigation into crimes committed in the Ukraine, which will likely include those committed by Russian forces in Crimea and its proxies in eastern Ukraine. Many close U.S. allies see the ICC as an important component of a larger international system to protect civilians, strengthen deterrence, advance accountability, and rehabilitate the survivors of international crimes.

5. Compliance with International Humanitarian Law

The United States is deeply committed to promoting the norms of International Humanitarian Law (IHL). As with its support for accountability and justice, this commitment has long historical roots, dating back to the issuance of the Lieber Code governing Union forces in 1863—one of the first codifications of IHL. In recent times, the scale and breadth of U.S. military deployments and engagements amplifies the critical significance of IHL and the imperative that all conflict parties comply with IHL, which serves to protect U.S. personnel and civilians. The United States invests heavily in compliance and in training its own military forces in IHL and human rights law. The reasons for this are pragmatic as well as principled. The U.S. Law of War Manual identifies “strong self-interest \[in compliance with IHL\] of everyone subject to the law of war,” including by reinforcing military effectiveness, supporting military discipline, encouraging reciprocal compliance by adversaries, and maintaining public support. As General Clark has affirmed, compliance with IHL by U.S. actors serves “not only to protect innocent civilians but also to protect its own military forces. American men and women in uniform benefit from the expectation that all parties to a conflict will respect the Geneva Conventions and customary international law. … When the United States holds itself to these rules, allies that share the same values have greater confidence to work with the United States.”

\[_Text Box—Foreword to the US Law of War Manual: The law of war is a part of our military heritage, and obeying it is the right thing to do. But we also know that the law of war poses no obstacle to fighting well and prevailing. Nations have developed the law of war to be fundamentally consistent with the military doctrines that are the basis for effective combat operations. For example, the self-control needed to refrain from violations of the law of war under the stresses of combat is the same good order and discipline necessary to operate cohesively and victoriously in battle. Similarly, the law of war’s prohibitions on torture and unnecessary destruction are consistent with the practical insight that such actions ultimately frustrate rather than accomplish the mission. … Understanding our duties imposed by the law of war and our rights under it is essential to our service in the nation’s defense_.\]

Through various assistance programs, the United States similarly supports training and compliance initiatives with the armed forces of other nations—including military exchanges, bringing foreign military lawyers to participate in courses at the U.S. Army JAG School, and State Department-funded training and capacity building programs—which ensures norm diffusion, interoperability, and the protection of the reputation of the U.S. military when conducting joint operations. The United States also recognizes the importance of compliance with IHL in promoting stability and preventing atrocity, viewing “compliance with international law, including humanitarian law and principles” as a facet of its stabilization goal under the 2020 Strategy to Prevent Conflict and Promote Stability, and noting that the Department of Defense capacity building programs for foreign security forces “help partner countries more effectively prevent and respond to atrocities … includ\[ing\] training on respecting the law of armed conflict \[and\] the rule of law.” Its commitment to these issues has also been demonstrated in other ways, such as extensive vetting of partner forces, so-called Leahy vetting, to ensure that U.S. funds do not underwrite individuals or groups with a history of engaging in violations. While the United States’ record is far from perfect in this regard, these initiatives evidence a commitment by the United States to prevent violations of IHL as well as provide accountability when they do occur.

The Rome Statute is intended to reinforce compliance with IHL and accountability for violations, with former ICC President Sang-Hyun Song identifying the ICC’s core role as “enforcing and inducing compliance with specific norms of international law aimed at outlawing and preventing mass violence.” The majority of the war crimes cases in which the Court has prosecuted or issued indictments involve acts that are criminal under U.S. law as well: the deliberate targeting of civilians as a military strategy or tactic; the commission of rape or other acts of sexual violence during conflicts; the conscription of child soldiers; and deliberate attacks on peacekeepers or precious cultural property.

6. Interpretation and Development of International Law (including IHL)

The ways in which IHL, and states’ understanding of their obligations under IHL, evolve and develop is also critical to the United States. The United States has recognized that international criminal tribunals will inevitably influence the development of international law: it submitted _amicus_ briefs to the ICTY when important questions of law arose to help shape the development of the law and it has hailed the work of the ICTY as “establish\[ing\] key precedents in international criminal law.” Given its mandate, the ICC will inevitably address a range of IHL issues in which the United States has an interest. For example, the judgment of the Appeals Chamber in _Prosecutor v. Bemba_ addressed questions of superior responsibility, especially in the context of delegated and remote command over troops in coalition actions, and questions of conflict classification (between government forces and an armed group receiving varying levels of foreign support) arose repeatedly in _Prosecutor v Lubanga_. The ICC’s decisions may also invoke other international law issues—for example, the obligation to investigate and prosecute crimes associated with armed conflict, the grounds on which officials may enjoy immunity for conduct that allegedly constitutes international crimes, the reach of various forms of responsibility, and the circumstances in which a state may be held responsible for the conduct of armed groups to which it may wish to provide support. These issues touch on core U.S. foreign policy priorities, such as potential assistance to members of the moderate armed opposition in Syria and arms sales to the parties to the conflict in Yemen. The Court’s approach to these issues will inevitably influence the views of other members of the international community, particularly given that many states have updated their penal codes to include international crimes as defined by the Rome Statute and will inevitably look to the Court’s jurisprudence for interpretive guidance.

Separately, the ICC Assembly of States Parties may take actions that affect the views states have of their obligations under customary international law. For example, U.S. participation in the negotiations around amendments to the Court’s subject matter jurisdiction—adding the crime of aggression and several new war crimes in non-international armed conflicts—was in fact critical for preserving the U.S. position. Future ASP discussions could well be expected to address such important emerging issues as cyberattacks and the responsibility for large-scale environmental damage under international law. The United States thus has a strong interest in ensuring that its voice and perspectives are present in these discussions, and that it does not cede this forum to other states whose interests or interpretations of the law may not be aligned with those of the United States.

7. Promoting the Rule of Law

As a pillar of its foreign policy, the United States encourages the promotion of the rule of law globally as an essential part of free, open, prosperous, and stable societies. These principles align strongly with the objectives of the Rome Statute. The Court represents an effort by the international community to encourage sovereign national authorities to provide accountability when there have been violations of core norms and reflects a commitment by states to provide judicial accountability (not just political sanctions) when that fails. The foundational principle of the ICC—“that it is the duty of every State to exercise its criminal jurisdiction over those responsible for international crimes” and that the ICC “shall be complementary to national criminal jurisdictions”—also encourages domestic legal systems to take responsibility for investigating and, where warranted, prosecuting criminal conduct over which they have jurisdiction. To the extent that the Court encourages prosecutions of international crimes in domestic courts, and accountability more generally, its activities align with United States interests in promoting democratic, prosperous, and stable societies.

This commitment and contribution to supporting the rule of law is often most important in the very situations where the ICC is most likely to be active—in countries that recently experienced conflict or mass atrocity, that are emerging from periods of repression and authoritarianism, and in which domestic institutions or commitment to the rule of law may be weak or poorly instantiated. Indeed, at the 2010 Kampala Review Conference the United States “renew\[ed\] its commitment to support rule-of-law and capacity building projects which will enhance States’ ability to hold accountable those responsible for war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide”. The United States has provided substantial support to strengthen the rule of law, including in countries where the ICC is conducting investigations, and this support has frequently included or been linked with accountability efforts. Congress has also noted the importance of this assistance, in certain contexts, in strengthening the mutual interests of the United States and counties recovering from conflict, and in combating foreign (including Russian) influence.

8. Effective U.S. Diplomacy and “Soft Power”

As noted above, the United States’ relationship with the ICC is both affected by, and is a part of, its wider approach to multilateral engagement and other international organizations. The great majority of U.S. allies are Rome Statute parties and are committed to the realization of the Court’s mission. In the Task Force’s consultations, foreign interlocutors repeatedly noted that the manner in which the United States addresses ICC-related issues frames their perceptions of its commitment on broader issues of accountability, human rights, and the rule of law, and the extent to which they can and should work cooperatively with the United States on such issues. It also affects their views of the United States as a responsible international partner in other contexts. In addition, U.S. attacks on the Court have been seen as empowering despots keen on undermining justice and rule of law efforts in their own countries. This all remains true even in the face of doubts increasingly being expressed by ICC supporters about the Court’s performance.

To be sure, the diplomatic costs of opposing the ICC are not as high now as they were in the early days of the Court. However, the uniform rejection of the sanctions EO and the designations thereunder show that our allies will defend the Court in the face of an attack that is deemed unwarranted or unfair. Many of our interlocutors contended that the bellicose stance of the Trump Administration made it more difficult to push for the kinds of reforms that the Court desperately needs as part of the IER and other reform efforts. They also noted that, at a minimum, the EO had forced traditional U.S. allies to distance themselves from the U.S. position.

In addition, the reality is that the United States is often engaged on the ground in many countries where the ICC is operating in one capacity or another. Active hostility towards the ICC deprives the United States of the opportunity to develop goodwill through positive engagement with ICC efforts in countries where investigations have broad popular support or are seen as important (and in some cases the only realistic) efforts to provide accountability for serious violations of international law and justice for victims. One interlocutor contrasted the current U.S. approach to the ICC with the ways in which U.S. support for the ICTY generated goodwill for U.S. forces on the ground in Bosnia-Herzegovina, where the tribunal was seen as an important venue to pursue justice. Another raised concerns that undifferentiated attacks by the United States on the Court risks alienating those parts of the population that are seeking justice for atrocities.

All told, the U.S. relationship with the ICC, and the way in which the U.S. pursues and expresses that relationship, indelibly affects the reputation of United States as a supporter of accountability, human rights, and rule of law—important components of its “soft power.” It is, quite simply, impossible to separate the U.S. approach to the ICC from other questions of international justice and accountability.

## Conclusion

This discussion reveals that an array of U.S. interests intersects with the Court’s activities. To be sure, developments in the Afghanistan and Palestine situations loom large in the recent responses of some policymakers and figured prominently in the Task Force’s discussions. However, our consultations also highlighted that these are not the only U.S. interests implicated by the ICC and its activities, particularly given that over the years, the United States has been broadly supportive of accountability—which includes the work of the Court—in all the other situation countries. In addition, the U.S. relationship with the ICC does not exist in a vacuum. It is inevitably influenced by, and is a part of, the broader U.S. approach to working with, and within, international institutions. For the incoming Administration, this suggests that it will need to find a way forward that fits with, and contributes to, its more general approach to multilateralism, which by all accounts is intended to be based on a willingness to engage constructively on global challenges (including contentious issues), be respectful of the reasonable views of allies and friends, and place significant emphasis on advancing accountability, human rights, and rule of law. Any assessment of the options for pragmatic engagement by the U.S. with the ICC must thus best based on a recognition of the full range of interests that the ICC may affect.

6. Policy Options for Pragmatic Engagement

Although the U.S.-ICC relationship has evolved over the years, driven largely by the salience and potency of competing considerations, the objectives and work of the Court implicate core commitments to justice and accountability that are foundational to U.S. foreign policy in many situations around the world. This brings into stark relief the need to chart a course that best balances the United States’ ability to advance these interests and the desire to protect against countervailing risks. This diversity of perspectives on what is desirable when it comes to United States engagement with the Court, along with the pragmatic reality that different forms of engagement may be more or less feasible at different points in time, suggested to the Task Force that it should disaggregate the different forms of engagement that the United States could undertake. With this in mind, the recommendations that follow are broken into four sections:

(A) _“Clearing the Air” and Re-Casting the Tone:_ Steps that the new Administration should take immediately so as to reinforce its overall approach to multilateralism and international institutions; to underscore that the United States shares the goals of the ICC; and to help strengthen the credibility of the United States as a dependable voice on issues of accountability, human rights, and the rule of law.

(B) _Steps that the U.S. Should Pursue Regardless of Concerns About the ICC_: Steps that are independently constructive and consistent with its values that the United States should consider taking regardless of the general state of its relations with the ICC at any given time.

(C) _Approaches for Dealing With the Three Biggest Issues_: Recommendations for how the United States could approach Afghanistan, Palestine, and the opportunities implicated by the review and reform process being undertaken by Rome Statute Parties—which the Task Force sees as closely correlated.

(D) _Possibilities for Support for ICC Efforts in Particular Situation Countries_: Finally, a set of considerations for providing support for particular investigations and prosecutions in appropriate circumstances.

In developing these recommendations, the Task Force was mindful of its mandate to recommend options that are “pragmatic.” The Task Force did not, for example, consider ratification of the Rome Statute by the United States at this point to be pragmatic given the breadth of other challenges facing the Biden administration, the collection of other treaties in line for ratification, and the political lift that ratification would entail. Indeed, almost none of the interlocutors with whom the Task Force spoke advocated for, or expected, the United States to ratify the Statute (at least in the foreseeable future). The Task Force has, however, considered a wide range of options in light of the historical engagement by the United States with the ICC and other international criminal tribunals, what lines of reasoning have or have not proven persuasive, how elements of the international community have reacted to past approaches; in short, whether particular forms of engagement could be expected effectively to advance U.S. interests.

## A. “Clearing the Air” and Re-Casting the Tone

As noted above, the relationship of the United States with the ICC cannot exist in a vacuum. In this connection, the Task Force believes it will be important for the new Administration to speak about the Court and its personnel in a manner that comports with its overall approach to multilateralism, international institutions, and working with friends and allies. This would entail maintaining a measured tone in which the United States speaks about the ICC and its personnel.

There will be many advantages of this general approach. In particular, U.S. attacks on the Court over the last four years—including President Trump’s Executive Order determining that the ICC’s work was an “unusual and extraordinary threat” to national security and Secretary Pompeo’s imposition of economic sanctions on the ICC Prosecutor and one of her staff—have come at significant cost to the U.S. reputation and to its ability to be an effective voice on issues of importance to it. Numerous interlocutors with whom the Task Force spoke viewed the imposition of such sanctions—which are normally deployed against terrorists, weapons of mass destruction proliferators, narcotics traffickers, and perpetrators of heinous atrocities—as [an affront](https://www.justsecurity.org/72256/the-intl-criminal-court-executive-order-global-reactions-compiled/), and told us that the net effect was to prompt numerous states, including many that had been expressing concerns about the Court’s performance and the need for reform, to rally in defense of the Court. Statements that the Administration’s goal was to dissolve the Court, allegations for which no evidence was provided that the Court had been corrupted, references to the ICC as a “kangaroo court,” and other consistently disdainful public rhetoric about the Court and its officials added to the feeling that the Court needed to be defended. Many of our interlocutors also believed that the Administration’s approach made it more difficult to pursue reforms that would have been in the interests of the United States.

\[The Task Force believes that the revocation of Executive Order 13928 on DATE was an essential first step. / As of the date that this Report is being sent to the printer, the sanctions remain in place. If it has not already done so by the time this Report is published, the Task Force recommends that the new Administration revoke Executive Order 13928 and the sanctions under it that have been imposed against ICC personnel, and that it do so as soon as possible. It also recommends that the United States reverse any visa restrictions or revocations that may have been put into place against ICC personnel, and that it communicate this (whether publicly or privately) to the Court or the officials impacted.\]

There are also a number of further steps that the United States should take in the immediate term to reposition itself as a reliable, constructive, and respectful ally and partner in multilateral engagements. Perhaps most importantly: the Administration should publicly and decisively disavow any impression that its goal is the dissolution of the Court. Neither the actual termination of the Court’s existence, nor the United States being seen as favoring such an outcome, is in the United States’ interest. Too much of what the Court actually does serves U.S. interests, too many U.S. friends remain supportive of the Court and dedicated to its improvement, and—for all its flaws—there is no institution that could take its place. Attacks by the United States on the Court create a climate that make sympathy and receptivity for U.S. concerns less likely. In addition, a hostile U.S. posture provides cover for autocratic rulers to undermine the rule of law, attack domestic checks on their power, and resist international efforts to promote accountability.

The new Administration should also make clear that it will cease the vitriolic rhetoric that has marked the last four years. In particular, the Administration should avoid _ad hominem_ allegations about corruption or bad faith, at least unless it is prepared to come forward with persuasive evidence to back up its claims if particular situations arise. It should also clearly repudiate the rhetoric that accompanied the pardons and commutations of sentence granted to U.S. servicemembers and military contractors accused or convicted of war crimes, which numerous interlocutors believed “did great damage” to U.S. credibility on accountability and the willingness of other states or the ICC to defer to U.S. investigations. None of this requires the United States to abandon its concerns about the Court, but there is no reason that it cannot put forward its concerns in a reasoned manner that is respectful of the good faith views of the numerous friends and allies of the United States that are Court supporters.

## B. Steps that the U.S. Should Pursue Regardless of Specific Concerns About the ICC

There are a number of steps that the Task Force believes that the United States should undertake no matter what state of the relationship between the United States and the ICC.

1. Enhance General Support for International Justice Efforts

The United States has a longstanding commitment to the project of global criminal justice. This promotion of accountability for international crimes has continued through periods in which the United States was more engaged with the ICC as well as periods in which it was more skeptical or hostile. Even during the last administration when relations with the Court reached a new low, Congress passed a number of important pieces of legislation aimed at advancing international justice in a number of ICC situation countries, generating more information about the risk of mass violence, and sharpening the United States’ atrocities prevention and response tools. Interlocutors from across the political spectrum stressed that the United States should continue to manifest in word and deed its principled determination that those responsible for atrocities should be held to account. Indeed, a number of interlocutors from foreign governments led by reiterating that they want the United States to be an ally in the fight against impunity.

The interests of the United States in accountability and the rule of law extend beyond the ICC. The United States has devoted considerable energy and resources to promoting the principle of accountability, and it should continue to do so. While the ICC looms large in many discussions of international accountability, even the Court’s strongest supporters recognize the importance of delivering justice at or closer to the local level. The ICC can only ever be one small part of a larger global accountability effort, which includes hybrid institutions, national courts and any number of locally-tailored efforts. The Rome Statute itself its predicated on the primary “duty of every State to exercise its criminal jurisdiction over those responsible for international crimes” and that accountability for international crimes “must be ensured by taking measures at the national level and by enhancing international cooperation.” The United States should not let its views on that one piece (whatever they may be at any point in time) overshadow or compromise its commitment to the whole.

Indeed, the United States has a commendable track record of supporting local, mobile, and hybrid courts in the DRC and CAR as well as international investigative mechanisms, such as those for Iraq, Syria, Myanmar, and Guatemala, and funding civil society groups in a wide range of countries to enable vital work documenting atrocity crimes and advocating for accountability. The Task Force recommends that the United States continue its longstanding support for such efforts to promote accountability for international crimes, including local investigations, documentation, and victim rehabilitation by domestic, hybrid, and other international institutions. Such support should proceed regardless of the state of U.S.-ICC relations and regardless of whether the ICC is also operating in a particular situation country.

2. Build Accountability into the President’s National Security Strategy

As noted above, the National Security Strategy under at least the past three Presidents has noted the threat that mass atrocities pose to U.S. national security and affirmed that the prevention atrocities and accountability for the perpetrators of international crimes is squarely in the U.S. national interest (see XXX, above). The new Administration should explicitly maintain and strengthen this focus when it produces its first National Security Strategy. Doing so would reinforce the U.S. commitment to global justice and stability, and would encourage interagency coordination and empower the functional offices whose mandates involve the promotion of international justice.

3. Attend and Participate in the ASP And Other Relevant Meetings And Conferences

The Task Force recommends that the United States participate fully in the annual meetings of the ICC Assembly of States Parties and other ICC-related international meetings and conferences. The meetings present a clear opportunity to represent the views of the United States and to understand the views being expressed by other states, and by Court actors, so as to best position itself to formulate and articulate policies and positions in a manner that will advance the interests of the United States. As exemplified by the outcome of U.S. engagement on the crime of aggression, the Task Force believes it makes little sense for the United States to deny itself the opportunity to understand the views of others and to explain its positions in ways most likely to be influential simply because we have concerns—even serious ones—about the Court’s activities.

The United States should be represented by an official at an appropriately senior level (e.g. the Ambassador-at-Large for Global Criminal Justice and/or the State Department Legal Adviser) to be able to share U.S. views, speak credibly on the importance that the United States places on accountability, highlight matters of common interest, articulate U.S. priorities regarding global criminal justice, and voice any concerns. Such activities are not inherently “supportive” of the Court, but they position the United States to better advance its views and interests and avoid ceding a forum in which other states may assert or pursue their interests unopposed. There are opportunity costs to not attending those gatherings. As Secretary of State Blinken has said, “if \[the United States is\] not in there and present ... helping to write the rules and shape \[international norms\], then either someone else is going to do it in our place, or maybe just as bad, no one does it and you have chaos.”

4. Preserve Political Capital When it Comes to Diplomatic References to the ICC

The United States should rationalize its posture towards references to the ICC in resolutions in the United Nations and other multilateral fora. The Task Force recommends that the United States should not withhold support for resolutions or declarations supporting international justice simply because those resolutions mention the ICC. Nor should it insist on the deletion of all references to the ICC in resolutions that are devoted to issues that the United States cares about, such as preventing the recruitment and use of child soldiers or ensuring documentation for international crimes being considered by the Court. Doing so wastes U.S. political capital, which can be better used to pursue concrete U.S. national interests. Such semantic battles too often divide the United States from its allies and aligns it with states that are hostile to U.S. values of justice, accountability, and the rule of law. To be sure, there may be circumstances in which a reference to the ICC would be inappropriate or counter-productive, but more generalized references in connection with resolutions devoted to the imperatives of justice and accountability should not provoke U.S. ire.

5. Actively Follow the Court’s Substantive Jurisprudence

Whatever the views of the United States about the Court, it has a strong interest in following its substantive jurisprudence. There is no question that its caselaw is highly influential and considered authoritative by a number of states. In the past several years, the Court has issued numerous decisions that bear on the interpretation and application of international humanitarian law. The Court’s decisions inevitably affect the way at least some countries, including allies with whom the United States cooperates militarily, view such substantive legal issues and their understanding of their legal obligations. It is plainly in the interests of the United States to follow the case law closely, and to be in a position to react as appropriate, including to engage with legal counterparts in other states, regarding any of the Court’s jurisprudence with respect to which the United States may have a strong interest.

6. Pursue Possibility of Sanctions Against Persons Sought by the ICC

The United States should support the imposition of sanctions in appropriate cases against individuals indicted by the ICC. Many of these individuals are likely to be persons whom the United States would support sanctioning for their role in the commission of international crimes. Indeed, the United States has sanctioned at least 13 individuals for whom the ICC had issued arrest warrants. The United States should certainly not be in the position of declining to impose sanctions against persons that would otherwise be deserving of them simply because they have been subject to ICC indictment. Depending on the circumstances, the United States could work to impose such sanctions on a multilateral basis through the Security Council, or under domestic authorities, _e.g._, in connection with the Global Magnitsky program and similar authorities. In cases in which it imposes sanctions under domestic authorities, the United States should to the extent feasible work with friends and allies to impose similar sanctions to magnify their impact.

7. Implement a No Contacts or Restricted Contacts Policy

Similarly, the United States should consider developing a no, or restricted, contacts policy with respect to individuals subject to an ICC arrest warrant (and perhaps a summons to appear as well). A number of allied states, including the United Kingdom \[and the European Union\], have such policies, as does the United Nations. Such policies reflect that the indictment of a person by the Court is based on a finding that “there are reasonable grounds to believe that the person has committed” genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes \[or the crime of aggression\], and is therefore normally a good indication that the United States should at least consider eliminating or restricting contacts. There would, of course, need to be appropriate exceptions, e.g., for essential contacts or other situations in which application of the policy would be unwarranted.

8. Task U.S. Diplomatic Missions to Report on Relevant ICC Developments   
   and Views of Host States about the Court

Likewise, the United States should track the activity of Court actors in ICC situation countries. The Task Force recommends that the State Department consider tasking relevant U.S. diplomatic missions to report on developments related to ICC activities. This could include reporting from missions in countries that are under investigation or preliminary examination (or whose nationals are implicated in such proceedings) on the reaction of host state governments and members of the public and on related accountability and transitional justice initiatives underway in the national judicial systems, including the rehabilitation of survivors. It could also include reporting on the views of U.S. partners and allies on the ICC’s activities and on the ongoing process of review and reforms. Finally, the United States should be actively gathering information from countries that are undergoing or are at risk of mass violence and may fall within the jurisdiction of the Court. As manifested by legislation mandating greater information sharing with Congress, such information will be critical as the new Administration develops and articulates its policy toward the ICC as well as toward accountability issues more generally.

9. Provide Reporting to Congress on Activities Undertaken by ICC in other Situations and Enhancing Opportunities for Engagement between the U.S. Government and the ICC

The same is true for other reporting and briefings that the State Department provides regarding developments in countries in which the ICC is playing or considering playing an active role. The State Department should be straightforward in its assessments of these developments, and relevant congressional committees should encourage the Department to provide briefings on the role being played by the ICC and its effect on the broader situation in that country. The United States can maintain any concerns about particular Court actions while still recognizing that the ICC plays a valuable role in many of the places in which it operates, and indeed is often welcomed by the governments of, and by survivors in, states with which we are partnering.

In this connection, the U.S. government should also fully the Elie Wiesel Genocide and Atrocities Prevention Act and Related Legislation Aimed at Atrocities Prevention and Response This legislation was signed into law in 2019 to reflect Congress’ recognition of the critical importance of U.S. government efforts at atrocity prevention. Among other things, the legislation requires annual reports from the Executive branch on efforts to prevent and respond to atrocities, a description of countries considered to be at risk, and a consideration of analysis, reporting, and policy recommendations produced by civil society, academic, and other non-governmental organizations and institutions. Past reports have noted the importance of efforts to hold accountable those responsible for atrocities in a number of countries in which the ICC has been pursuing investigations and prosecutions, but have not mentioned the ICC.

The Task Force believes it would be beneficial for the State Department, in preparing future reports, to take a more straightforward approach to mentioning the role of the ICC in its reports under the legislation and other communications with Congress. This could both help provide a fuller understanding to the public and to the congressional committees for which the reports are intended of the landscape of efforts to prevent and punish international crimes, and could also help bring greater focus to the question of the extent to which ICC involvement in various countries aligns with United States policy objectives in promoting accountability. All this could be undertaken irrespective of the extent to which the United States supports or opposes the ICC’s work as a general matter.

More generally, the Administration and relevant congressional committees should consider encouraging greater contacts between Executive branch agencies and congressional members and staff, on the one hand, and ICC representatives (from across the Court’s organs) on the other. Such contacts—at the principal and working levels—could play a useful role in de-mystifying perceptions of the ICC’s work and build greater appreciation for the contributions that it is making to advancing the cause of justice in the great majority of situations in which the Court is operating, In a similar way, the Administration and congressional committees could consider the desirability of inviting relevant staff to attend the annual meeting of the Assembly of States parties (in the same way that congressional staff attended the 2010 ICC Review Conference in Kampala).

10. Acceptance of Information/Evidence from ICC

Article 93(10)(c) of the Rome Statute authorizes the Court to provide assistance to non-member states that are investigating or prosecuting international or other serious crimes. Interlocutors who have worked in other international criminal tribunals report providing assistance to U.S. authorities, including in connection with Immigration and Customs Enforcement actions (e.g. charges of immigration fraud when the individual denied involvement in atrocities when receiving an immigration benefit) or Treasury Department sanctions. Given the range of situations that the ICC is investigating, it may well be in a position at some point to provide similar information and evidence to support a range of U.S. enforcement actions, including Department of Justice prosecutions in trafficking, terrorism, torture, war crimes, or other international crimes. In principle, the United States should stand ready to receive such assistance if a case arises in which the Court is able and willing to provide such assistance.

11. Maintain the Office of Global Criminal Justice and the Position of Ambassador-at-Large

The Task Force recommends that the United States continue to support and empower the State Department’s Office of Global Criminal Justice, including by the expeditious appointment and confirmation of a new Ambassador-at-Large for Global Criminal Justice. In 2017, there was speculation that the Trump Administration would shutter the office. This prospect received significant negative press and sparked a critical countermovement within civil society and beyond. In the face of such blowback, then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson announced his decision to maintain the Office.

The Office should maintain its autonomy within the Undersecretariat for Civilian Security, Democracy, and Human Rights (the “J” Undersecretariat) given that its mandate and perspective are unique and highly specialized. The U.S. government needs an empowered Ambassador-at-Large, with her or his own voice to speak forcefully and effectively on behalf of the United States on accountability issues. The fact that the United States is the only country with a dedicated ambassadorial-level position enables the United States to address these issues in a manner that ensures the attention of other governments, victims and survivors, and the general public. The Office should also ensure its personnel have the requisite technical expertise but also a regularized status to ensure continuity and efficacy within the inter-agency and multilateral fora. Maintaining adequate personnel is particularly important given that Congress has provided increased programming funds to advance the mandate of the Office. The Office of Global Justice will remain an important liaison point for such programming funds and U.S. policy in atrocity prevention and response more generally.

12. Assure Steady and Predictable Funding for _Ad Hoc_ and Hybrid Tribunals   
    and Other Local and International Justice Efforts

The United States has regularly funded international justice efforts, as discussed above (XXX), and should continue to do so. This includes the Extraordinary African Chambers, which prosecuted Hissène Habré of Chad for the commission of grave international crimes while he was President of Chad. The United States provided direct funding to the Special Court for Sierra Leone and Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia and supported the disbursement of subvention grants for the Special Court for Sierra Leone and the ECCC when voluntary contributions ran short. The United States has also funded local efforts, including mobile courts and other transitional justice mechanism. The United States should continue to capacitate such efforts, perhaps out of a standing justice fund that could be accessed as needed. In 2020, for example, Congress directed $10 million for the office, a positive development from the point of view of helping to overcome funding difficulties the United States has faced in the past because of the difficulty of ensuring a consistent flow of funding for otherwise cost-effective alternatives to big, expensive international courts. The Task Force recommends that Congress continue and build upon this line of funding.

13. Continue to Issue Rewards under the War Crimes Rewards Program

The United States should also maintain and expand its War Crimes Rewards Program. The program has time and again served as a key U.S. contribution to ensuring that those credibly accused of the most serious international crimes face justice. It is a high-profile and tangible signal of the United States commitment to accountability, and its continuation helps underscore that support within the United States for the underlying principle of accountability is deeply bipartisan. Thus, when the program was extended in 2013 to enable rewards to be offered for information leading to the arrest, transfer or conviction of individuals to other international criminal tribunals, including the ICC, members of the House of Representatives described this as “a critical tool,” “a responsible, bipartisan bill that will significantly enhance our ability to fight transnational organized crime and grave human rights abuses,” and “a technique that works.” Then Secretary of State John Kerry attested to the practical impact of the Program:

“Can it work? You bet it can. Two weeks ago, one of the most notorious and brutal rebels in the DRC voluntarily surrendered to our Embassy in Rwanda shortly after being named to the War Crimes Reward Programs list. Now Bosco Ntaganda is charged by the International Criminal Court with war crimes and crimes against humanity. I would have been announcing a reward for him today, but instead, he is sitting in a cell at The Hague.”

Especially in light of the bipartisan support for this initiative, the United States should continue to fund and implement this program. In terms of potential expansion, the United States should review all suspects for whom the ICC has issued arrest warrants and who remain at large to determine whether to offer rewards for information leading to their arrest, transfer, or conviction. This is particularly appropriate in cases in which the United States does not object to the basis on which the ICC is exercising its jurisdiction, such as those involving nationals of a state party or whose arrest is sought in connection with a situation referred by the U.N. Security Council.

14. Support Victims and Survivors of International Crimes

Support for the victims and survivors of atrocity crimes, like accountability for perpetrators, enjoys broad bipartisan support in the United States (see XXX, above). The United States should continue this support, including by looking for opportunities to provide in-country assistance and rehabilitation for victims of atrocity crimes and supporting organizations and legal representatives that assist victims in seeking justice.

Giving voice to survivors featured prominently in the negotiations of the Rome Statute, and its reflected in a range of provisions, including its Victims and Witnesses Unit (Article 44(6)), provisions providing for the participation of victims in proceedings (Article 68(3)), the power of the Court to order reparations against convicted persons (Article 75), and the contemplation of a Trust Fund for Victims (TFV) “for the benefit of victims of crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court, and of the families of such victims” (Article 79(1)).

The United States’ ability to support most of these initiatives is limited by the FRAA, which prevents the United States from providing funds to the ICC. However, under the Rome Statute, the Trust Fund for Victims is an entity that is distinct from the organs of the Court. Unlike the ICC, it was established by a decision of the Assembly of States Parties, rather than directly by the Rome Statute. Further, the TFV is governed by an independent five-member Board of Directors and not by the Court personnel. The Trust Fund has two distinct functions: managing reparations orders and providing separate assistance programs in victimized communities in ICC situation countries. The reparations orders are linked with, and dependent on, an ICC guilty verdict and reparations award, but the assistance programs are independent of any Court (and in particular any prosecutorial) activity. In other words, while any assistance provided must go to victims of crimes that are within the jurisdiction of the Court, the TFV’s assistance programs are not linked with any particular investigation or prosecution. To the contrary, the assistance mandate was designed to be both more responsive and broader than the prosecutorial and judicial processes.

The focus of the TFV’s assistance programs is providing physical and psychological rehabilitation, and material support, to individuals and communities that have suffered from atrocity crimes. This assistance dimension is entirely consistent with U.S. interests. A number of the TFV’s implementing partners are (or have been) U.S. entities, including the Center for Victims of Torture, Health Right International, and World Relief. And the United States does not object to the basis for the Court’s jurisdiction in any of the countries in which the Trust Fund is operating. To the contrary, the situations in which the TFV has assistance programs underway are amongst those where the United States has been heavily engaged in supporting accountability, rule of law, and support for victims: the DRC, Uganda, and the Central African Republic. For example, in Uganda, the TFV priorities include psychological support and material support for ex-child soldiers, abducted persons, and victims of sexual and gender-based violence. In addition, it is helping to provide prosthetic limbs for victims who suffered amputations in LRA attacks. In the CAR, the TFV’s current pilot project is focused on the long-term impacts of sexual and gender-based crimes, including providing medical care for the effects of HIV/AIDS and education for children of victims.

Making a contribution to the Trust Fund for Victims, as called for by the G-8 in 2013, provides the United States with an opportunity to send a tangible signal of its support for the underlying goals of the ICC and to confirm that any concerns that it has with the Court do not detract from its commitment to victim and survivor communities. It can make such a donation without supporting, providing funds to, or even engaging directly with the Court itself. Contributions to the Trust Fund can also be earmarked for specific projects, issues, or communities, thus ensuring that they are used in situations that the United States prioritizes. As such, the United States could provide funding for assistance that is closely aligned with other U.S. projects, for example support to survivors of sexual and gender-based violence in the eastern DRC. Or, it could discuss with the Trust Fund providing resources to expand its assistance programs into other areas where the United States sees a particular need, for example in Darfur to take advantage of, and support, the political developments in Sudan.

As such, the Task Force recommends that the United States review the operative legal authorities to determine whether it can lawfully provide contributions to the Trust Fund for Victims, and actively consider doing so to the extent possible. In the event that direct funding is determined not to be permissible, it should continue to empower and capacitate the TFV’s implementing partners that are focused on the psycho-social and economic rehabilitation of communities wracked by violence.

15. Contribute to Witness Protection Measures

The United States should continue to offer protection to vulnerable witnesses who are at risk as a result of their willingness to assist in the investigation and prosecution of atrocity crimes, including where those investigations and prosecutions are conducted by the ICC (provided that they do not implicate U.S. personnel). Many interlocutors from across the U.S. government observed that regardless of the U.S. stance toward the Court, protecting such vulnerable individuals is an independent moral imperative. Witnesses are the soft underbelly of the international justice system and are frequently the subject of intimidation, threats, and even violence. It takes great courage to speak truth to power, and such individuals deserve U.S. support and protect. The United States should also review the content and interpretation of legislation restricting U.S. cooperation with the ICC, so that by offering protection the United States does not impede the very investigations or prosecutions to which the witnesses contribute, for example by preventing witnesses from being interviewed in, or providing remote testimony from, U.S. territory.

16. Enact Crimes Against Humanity & Other Atrocities Crimes Legislation

The Executive Branch and the Congress should strongly consider adopting legislation that would permit the prosecution of persons found in the United States for crimes against humanity. The United States has legislation providing a basis for criminal prosecution of war crimes, the use of child soldiers, torture, a range of terrorism crimes, trafficking, slavery and forced labor, piracy, and genocide, but not crimes against humanity. Indeed, at the time of Under Secretary Grossman’s May 2002 speech comprehensively setting out the Bush Administration’s objections to the ICC, the Administration stated emphatically that it would “take steps to ensure that gaps in United States’ law do not allow persons wanted or indicted for genocide, war crimes, or crimes against humanity to seek safe haven on our soil in hopes of evading justice” (see page XX above). Enactment of such legislation would help vindicate this promise, serve as a powerful reaffirmation of the United States support for accountability, strengthen the ability of the United States to assert the primacy of its domestic jurisdiction over any attempts by the ICC or foreign courts to investigate or prosecute cases that may arise, and guard against the United States being used as a safe haven by persons alleged to have committed crimes against humanity. Along the lines of the recently-adopted European Union human rights sanctions regime, Congress should also consider explicitly including in legislation responsibility for atrocity crimes among the grounds on which the President can impose sanctions, possibly in connection with the anticipated reauthorization of the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act.

In addition, the United States should consider revising its war crimes statutes to better reflect the grave breaches regime set forth in the 1949 Geneva Conventions, which require states to exercise criminal jurisdiction regardless of the nationality of the perpetrator or victim. The existing legislation only allows for the assertion of criminal jurisdiction when the victim or perpetrator is a U.S. national, thus raising questions about whether the United States is compliant with its obligations under the Conventions. Amending the War Crimes Act would also bring it into line with other U.S. international crimes legislation, which allows for the exercise of jurisdiction when the perpetrator is found or present in the United States. Finally, Congress should ensure that appropriate legislation is in place so that U.S. courts can adjudicate the doctrine of superior responsibility, which at the moment is only applicable before U.S. military commissions.

Together, these gaps hinder the reach of the United States’ prosecutorial authorities and have led to instances of impunity, and incomplete accountability, where perpetrators in our midst cannot be prosecuted for their substantive crimes and must be dealt with through immigration and other remedies—a distant second-best option when crimes against humanity are at issue. Given the strong and bipartisan record of recent Congressional action supporting accountability for international crimes and the prevention of atrocities (see XXX, above), these proposed enactments may well find fertile ground. The Task Force therefore recommends that both the Executive branch and the Congress actively pursue appropriate legislation to achieve these objectives.

In addition to these domestic enactments, and notwithstanding the difficulties experienced by the United States in ratifying multilateral treaties, the United States should give serious consideration to and, ideally, promote the adoption of a treaty on the prevention and punishment of crimes against humanity, along the lines of the draft articles produced by the International Law Commission and currently under consideration before the General Assembly. In addition, the United States should give serious consideration to diplomatic processes to produce a proposed treaty on Mutual Legal Assistance for all atrocity crimes under consideration by some states. Both of these treaty efforts can play an important role in plugging significant gaps in the global treaty framework around atrocities crimes. As such, the United States should support these efforts even if domestic ratification may take significant time.

17. Prosecute International Crimes Domestically

As discussed, Congress has enacted a suite of statutes criminalizing various international crimes. In many cases, some foreign nationals who are present in the United States and are credibly accused of international crimes are prosecuted for immigration offences and/or deported, often due to the limitations of U.S. law discussed above. This includes instances when it might have been possible to hold them accountable for their underlying crimes rather than returning them to a national system that lacks the legal framework, juridical capacity, or political will to prosecute for the substantive crime or where the suspect’s reintroduction could exert a destabilizing effect or result in the intimidation or retraumatization of victims. The Task Force recommends that when individuals accused of international crimes are found on U.S. territory, the Department of Justice endeavor to prosecute them for their substantive crimes rather than relying exclusively on immigration remedies.

3. Dealing with the Biggest Issues: Afghanistan, Palestine,   
   and Issues Implicated by the Review and Reform Process

This section includes recommendations by the Task Force regarding what it considers to be the most salient issues on the current horizon for the U.S.-ICC relationship, all of which are in some ways inter-related. Potential investigations into the situations in Afghanistan and Palestine obviously present complex considerations for the Biden administration, but it should work to treat these situations as opportunities to emphasize both that the United States cares about accountability and that the Court will have a better chance of succeeding if the OTP and the judges better focus the Court’s resources where it stands to do the most good..

1. Afghanistan

In considering how the United States should respond to the Court’s investigation in Afghanistan, the Task Force believes that it is important to bear three important points in mind.

First, at the time of writing this Report, no case has been commenced against U.S. personnel linked to the Afghanistan situation, which covers an enormous crime base implicating the Taliban, Afghan national forces, and other non-state armed groups, such as the Haqqani Network—crimes that the Prosecutor’s own submission recognizes are far more extensive in scale than the allegations of torture against U.S. personnel during the 2000s. In the Task Force’s opinion, the United States should not treat the situation as if actual cases against U.S. persons are underway or a _fait accompli_. Accordingly, the Report includes recommendations on how the United States might make a persuasive case that the OTP and other Court actors should not expend their investigative, prosecutorial, or judicial resources on cases against U.S. personnel, building on opportunities presented by the current openness among Rome Statute parties and within the Court to constructive ideas for reform, and doing so in a manner that addresses not only the current situations but the risk of the ICC investigating or prosecuting U.S. personnel in the future.

Second, at least some of the conduct that is at issue constituted torture and other war crimes under international law (as described above in section XX). President Obama bluntly conceded as much in his statement in August 2014 that “we tortured some folks.” Said the President:

When we engaged in some of these enhanced interrogation techniques, techniques that I believe and I think any fair-minded person would believe were torture, we crossed a line. And that needs to be understood and accepted.

This reality cannot be overlooked. At the same time, it is equally clear that all prior administrations have strongly opposed an ICC investigation of these activities, and there are a range of good-faith arguments that the United States can legitimately put forward to support its position that the ICC should not investigate or prosecute U.S. persons. This Report recommends principled steps to address the possibility of the Court proceeding with a case against a U.S. person in connection with the Afghanistan situation. However, in doing so it is important not to minimize or trivialize the nature of the abuses that occurred.

Third, the nature of and reaction to the Trump Administration’s critiques of the ICC following the Court’s steps to open an investigation of Afghanistan, which generally fell into three categories—

1. the ICC Prosecutor and her staff are corrupt and politicized;
2. the ICC should not assert jurisdiction over nationals of states, like the United States, that are not party to the ICC treaty; and
3. the United States takes appropriate steps to investigate and prosecute its own.

With respect to the first category, given the serious nature of the abuses and the substantial evidence, the fact that the ICC Prosecutor has concluded there is a basis for investigating the events is hardly proof that drove those abuses that they are politically motivated or corrupt. If anything, _ad hominem_ attacks of this nature are likely to obscure better-reasoned defenses that are expressed in a non-polemic manner, or to lead listeners to conclude that the United States lacks a reasoned defense, unless it can back up its claims. There is no reason the United States cannot put forward its concerns and arguments in a reasoned manner that eschews such personal and unsupported attacks. Absent actual evidence—which the previous Administration claimed existed but never made available—this type of messaging has proved unpersuasive with other states and should not be pursued. Indeed, maintaining civil relations with Court actors and a constructive posture toward issues of accountability generally will be crucial in fostering an environment in which there is receptivity to arguments such as those that the Report proposes.

The second category described above encompasses arguments that it is impermissible, or just wrong, for the ICC to assert jurisdiction over the nationals of states, like the United States, that are not parties to the Rome Statute. It is often unclear whether the United States is putting this forward as a legal argument (_i.e_., it would be unlawful under international law for the ICC to assert jurisdiction over such nationals) or as a policy argument. Either way, such arguments have consistently proven to be unpersuasive, even to our closest allies. For its part, the Rome Statute clearly provides that the Court can exercise jurisdiction over such persons if the conduct in question occurred in the territory of a state party, and Afghanistan became a party in May 2003. To be sure, as a non-party, the United States is entitled to challenge the Rome Statute’s jurisdictional regime. The problem, however, is that the United States has never been able to develop or deploy a persuasive argument as to why states, which under international law indisputably have general authority to exercise jurisdiction with respect to conduct in their territory, are precluded from becoming party to a treaty under which they essentially delegate that authority to the ICC. Even if the Administration decides—as the Task Force assumes is likely—to continue to assert arguments against the ICC’s exercise of jurisdiction over nationals of non-parties, it is certain that the Court will not agree with those arguments and all-but-certain that U.S. allies will not help U.S. diplomats or lawyers advance this line of argument. Thus, if the goal is to be persuasive, the Administration needs to develop and articulate different reasons that it believes the Court should not pursue investigations of U.S. persons in Afghanistan.

This brings us to the third category: that the United States has done enough to address allegations of detainee abuse. The Task Force’s recommendations build on this line of argument, as the United States can argue in good faith that it took substantial steps to address the allegations and that, considering the totality of these steps together with the scale of the abuses and the other challenges facing the ICC, these are not matters that the ICC should pursue or prioritize.

Turning to the Task Force’s recommendations, as a starting point, given the very different circumstances surrounding the allegations against DOD personnel and CIA personnel, it would be helpful for the United States to distinguish clearly the allegations of torture and other abuse that have been raised against DOD personnel and the allegations of such crimes in connection with the CIA’s enhanced interrogation program. Accordingly, we separate our recommendations with respect to DOD allegations from those with respect to CIA allegations. In addition, assuming the new Administration believes that it would do more harm than good to re-open the Justice Department investigations of the CIA rendition program that were conducted during the Obama Administration, it should consider articulating the reasons for such a conclusion in a more persuasive manner.

(1) Allegations Related to DOD. With respect to the allegations against DOD personnel, the Prosecutor’s submission states that there is a reasonable basis to believe that “at least 54” persons were subject to detainee abuse by DOD personnel. The evidence that the Prosecutor relied on in seeking authorization to investigate implicitly reflects that the nature of the abuses alleged against DOD personnel are more limited, as many of the techniques listed (including some of the most severe) are based solely on evidence that relates to the CIA. In addition, the evidentiary basis upon which the Prosecutor concludes that the use of torture and other prohibited detainee abuse reflected a plan or policy is significantly less clear vis-à-vis the DOD, and even the Prosecutor’s own assessment is that any such policy appears to have been at a much lower level. And while creating a climate in which abuse occurred can be serious, even criminal, it is quite different than saying that there was an affirmative plan or policy in place to commit such acts, especially when the Prosecutor also recognized that they were “inflicted on a relatively small percentage of all persons detained by US armed forces … during a limited time period.” Indeed, the sources of information upon which much of the Prosecutor’s conclusions are based—the independent Church Report and Schlesinger Report—both concluded that abuses occurred but that there was no DOD policy of abuse. \[_See Text Box_\].

The Prosecutor’s application itself cites to reports of a range of DOD investigations and disciplinary proceedings, including reports of over 600 criminal investigations (covering Iraq and Afghanistan), over 70 investigations of detainee abuse by military personnel in Afghanistan leading to trials by courts-martial, and at least 54 persons convicted by courts-martial for detainee abuse in U.S. custody in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Guantánamo Bay. The Prosecutor appears to have discounted some or all of these for the purposes of her admissibility assessment based on concerns that the United States did not provide or make public sufficient detail of these actions, but merely provided statistics and overviews; that actions resulted only in administrative sanctions; and that there is no indication of investigations or proceedings against those most responsible (at the command or policy level) for the abuses.

Perhaps most importantly, because there is to date no indication that any such DOD policy was formulated in Washington, as implicitly acknowledged by the OTP, the prospect that those “most responsible” would occupy leadership positions, and by virtue of those leadership positions be able to prevent genuine investigations, would distinguish DOD activities from the activities of the CIA, which were approved at the highest levels of government. In light of the above, the Task Force recommends that, at the appropriate time, U.S. representatives seek clarity \[—and potentially a public statement—\] from the OTP reflecting the unlikelihood of the OTP pursuing charges in these cases. Such a statement regarding at least the DOD-related allegations could be a positive early step in building confidence between the parties, and based simply on practical realities—e.g., the Prosecutor’s acknowledgment that any DOD policy (if it existed at all) was not approved at senior levels; that it did not involve some of the more severe abuses, such as waterboarding, that occurred in connection with CIA activities; that the number of cases alleged would (even if proven) constitute only a very small portion of the number of detainees held in total by DOD personnel, and that there are reliable accounts of numerous internal investigations in the same reports upon which the OTP relies in drawing its conclusions that detainee abuse occurred in the first place—which taken together render it exceedingly unlikely that the OTP would prioritize such cases against U.S. persons.

(2) Allegations related to CIA. In regard to the allegations against the CIA, the concerns are more cogent. The fact is that the enhanced interrogation techniques constituting torture and other abuse were an express part of the CIA’s rendition and interrogation program. Both the acts of torture and abuse, and any failure to submit credible allegations to competent U.S. authorities for the purpose of prosecution, would violate United States obligations including under the Convention Against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment or Punishment. Yet no one was prosecuted for their role in conceptualizing, authorizing or implementing the CIA program.

Given the seriousness of these allegations involving the CIA, it would be in the interests of the United States to go beyond mere assertions that the United States does everything appropriate to investigate and prosecute and to articulate a tailored explanation of why it believes the ICC should not investigate or prosecute cases arising from the CIA program. As has already been seen, Trump Administration officials did put forward a complementarity rationale in their public statements, but only in the most general terms. There are at least two basic ways in which such a set of arguments could logically be strengthened.

First, the Administration could work to better explain the facts and circumstances surrounding the investigation undertaken by John Durham and the subsequent decision by the Department of Justice not to pursue prosecutions. Durham’s mandate did not extend to recommending the prosecution of individuals “who acted in good faith and within the scope of the legal guidance” provided by the Department of Justice regarding the legality of the interrogation techniques that were authorized. The Prosecutor appears to rely on this carve-out in concluding that the United States did not genuinely investigate individuals. In fact, at least some of the conduct cited—such as the allegations of rape and sexual assault—were not authorized at all and thus would clearly have fallen within Durham’s mandate to investigate. Even with respect to the authorized techniques, however, the United States could well take the position that the recognition of such a carve-out for reasonable reliance on DOJ legal advice was not unreasonable—_i.e_., that it would not be inappropriate for a national investigator or prosecutor to decline to pursue individuals who had relied in good faith on legal advice from those authorized to dispense it. As such, the fact that a national prosecutor would make such a decision is hardly proof that his efforts were not “genuine,” or were made for the purposes of shielding an accused, which is the test that the ICC would apply in determining whether cases would be admissible before the Court.

_\[Text Box: Durham’s mandate was to_

_recommend to the Attorney General whether there was sufficient predication for any full investigation into whether the law was violated in connection with any of these interrogations. In the event the Attorney General approved by my recommendations to launch a full criminal investigation, I again was to determine whether and criminal investigations should be brought._

_Declaration of John H. Durham, New York Times v. Department of Justice (8 December 2014), para. 6. Durham has confirmed in separate litigation that he “had full autonomy and independence,” id. para. 13, and that he submitted reports containing recommendations, that were approved, that he commence full investigations of the circumstances surrounding two deaths. According to Durham:_

_Among other things, these reports discussed the strengths and weaknesses of the facts and evidence uncovered in the course of preliminary reviews, the potential applicability of various criminal statutes against that evidence, and ultimately why no full criminal investigations should be pursued with the exception of the two matters._

_Id., para. 14. Durham further stated that his separate reports on those two matters—_

_contain an in-depth recitation, analysis, and evaluation of the facts and evidence uncovered in the course of \[his\] preliminary reviews as well as supporting legal and factual justification for \[his\] recommendation that full criminal investigations were warranted under the governing standards. These reports further outlined the key areas we would pursue in a full criminal investigation, as well as the potentially applicable criminal statutes._

_Id. para. 15. Finally, with respect to the two matters that were subject to full investigations, Durham stated that his reports—_

_memorialized our analyses and thought processes concerning whether to initiate any criminal prosecutions and out ultimate conclusion not to file charges. Specifically, the reports traced the path of our investigations into the two detainee deaths, highlighting critical investigative steps, and analysed the substantial volume of evidence gathered during the investigations. Beyond evaluating facts, statements and testimony of witnesses, and other evidence as they related to the criminal investigations, these reports assessed the admissibility of the evidence in judicial proceedings and identified other strengths and weaknesses associated with the evidence. In addition, in light of our assessment of the evidence, the reports thoroughly analyzed the type and nature of criminal charges that could be brought against suspected wrongdoers, along with the various defenses that could be raised in opposition to such charges. The reports also discussed what the evidence showed and did not show, and evaluated investigations conducted by other entities._

_Id. para. 18.\]_

In practice, such arguments could be more persuasive if the United States makes available additional information about what investigative and analytical efforts Durham and other U.S. government actors actually undertook and the grounds on which they reached their conclusion that a criminal prosecution would not be feasible, warranted, or supported by sufficient available evidence. That said, it may well be difficult for the United States to take such steps in light generally-applicable rules and procedures about the extent to which it is permitted to divulge grand jury and other investigative information, whether to the ICC or other recipients. In addition, unlike states that are parties to the Rome Statute, the United States is not under any responsibility—and could not reasonably be expected—to modify its longstanding laws and procedures with respect to cases in which the ICC might be interested. It could thus argue fairly that it would be inappropriate in such circumstances for the ICC Prosecutor to draw negative inferences that no genuine investigation occurred simply because the United States is not in a position to provide such information, even if such inferences might be warranted with respect to a situation in which a state party—which would be obliged to conform its domestic legal framework to its cooperation obligations toward the Court—declined to provide such information.

That said, it would clearly be helpful for the United States to look for ways to bolster its defensive posture “on the merits.” A lack of persuasive explanations as to the basis of the decisions not to further pursue the possibility of criminal prosecutions has been a significant barrier to domestic and international acceptance of the lack of criminal accountability for U.S. custodial abuses. In this connection, the Task Force recommends that the Administration pursue former Attorney General Eric Holder’s 2015 recommendation to publicly release more information about the Justice Department’s criminal investigation into the abuses in Afghanistan, which Holder has said publicly “would show the world how hard his prosecutors tried to bring Bush-era torturers to justice.”

In addition, in light of the “carve out” in Durham’s investigation that excluded individuals “who acted in good faith and within the scope of the legal guidance,” several interlocutors raised additional questions about the lack of accountability for the Department of Justice lawyers responsible for dispensing that consequential legal advice, which has generated pervasive public criticism. For these Office of Legal Counsel lawyers, there were investigations undertaken during the Obama Administration by the Justice Department’s Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) focused on whether those lawyers should be referred for professional disciplinary proceedings. The Justice Department’s Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) issued a report on July 29, 2009, concluding that the authors engaged in professional misconduct by failing to provide “thorough, candid and objective analysis and indicated its intent to refer its finding of misconduct to relevant state bar disciplinary authorities. Ultimately, however, the senior Department of Justice official who reviewed OPR’s conclusions, Associate Deputy Attorney General David Margolis, decided not to adopt that Office’s findings. Notwithstanding what he determined were significant flaws in the torture memoranda, Margolis concluded in a 69-page analysis that the episode did not constitute professional misconduct. For its part, the Justice Department, during the Obama Administration, concluded that, in light of the Margolis memorandum, there existed no basis for criminal prosecution of the lawyers.

This outcome remains controversial. However, under the Rome Statute, the relevant test for the Prosecutor and the Court to apply in determining admissibility in a case against the lawyers would not be whether the advice that they provided in fact was wrong, or was given in bad faith, or even amounted to a war crime. Nor would the test be whether Margolis’s conclusion that the matter did not amount to professional misconduct, or the decision not to pursue criminal proceedings in light of that conclusion, was correct. Rather, in order to proceed, the determination would need to be made that the investigation of the matter conducted within the Justice Department was not conducted genuinely—i.e. that it was made to shield the person from responsibility. In other words, the United States need not establish that these responses were ideal, just that the Durham process—together with the OPR investigation and the many other steps taken as outlined below—provides an appropriate basis for the Prosecutor not to pursue investigations of the U.S. persons involved.

When considering a state’s response to the potential commission of international crimes within its jurisdiction, it is true that the Court’s jurisprudence suggests that, once an ICC case has been commenced, nothing short of investigations that entail the possibility of criminal prosecutions will satisfy its view of the Rome Statute’s rules on complementarity when there is a challenge to the Court’s jurisdiction over a particular individual. That said, particularly at the stage at which the overall situation—rather than cases against specific individuals—is being reviewed, there is increasing receptivity to the view that the Court’s traditional approach to complementarity is too narrow, and that responses that do not involve traditional criminal prosecutions should “count” in determining whether a state’s response is so inadequate that an ICC investigation of the situation should be pursued. In this connection, the United States should highlight responses within the U.S. system that did not involve traditional criminal prosecutions but that did address allegations of mistreatment and put in place important measures to guard against repetition. This would include calling attention to the rigor and output of various investigative commissions, legal and policy reforms (notably the enactment of the Detainee Treatment Act), the withdrawal of controversial legal advice, civil suits, and other steps aimed at preventing recurrence. Such views might arguably carry even greater weight when it comes to states that are not parties to the Rome Statute and have not consented to the complementarity regime or accepted its implementation over time.

In addition, there are the political realities to consider. Speaking of these issues years after the fact, one former senior U.S. human rights official defended what he called “a tacit political bargain” not to go further, pointing to (1) the fact that “the prosecution of a predecessor who belongs to a competing political party is likely to be perceived as politically motivated—no matter how warranted the prosecution;” (2) given the inevitable perception of politically-motivated prosecution, torture itself could become a partisan issue, and Republicans could feel the need to defend the practice of torture and even advocate for it; and (3) the ensuing polarization of torture as a partisan issue could have ended up preventing Congress from enacting the statutory prohibitions on torture under what became the McCain-Feinstein legislation.

Should the United States put this kind of logic forward as a basis upon which it believes that the Prosecutor should not pursue these cases? The Task Force recommends that the new Administration consider this issue with care, but also with caution. On the one hand, if the Administration believes that states should have political space to decline to pursue investigations or prosecutions for reasons along these lines, it should say so. Indeed, in the current political climate, given the great controversy about the prospect of prosecutions during this Administration for potentially unlawful conduct of members of the Trump Administration, it seems highly unlikely at this point that there would be an appetite to re-open allegations against Bush Administration officials—particularly allegations that the Obama Administration had already decided not to pursue. On the other hand, it is not hard to see how, if arguments of this type are legitimized, it would be difficult to articulate the boundary between societal decisions that should, and those that should not, be accepted by the ICC as a basis for not exercising jurisdiction.

Putting forward arguments along the lines suggested—and particularly regarding the Court’s admissibility criteria—in a principled and transparent manner could add to the credibility of the United States’ position with diplomatic partners and could even help elicit their support. They could also be a factor that the Prosecutor could take into account in discretionary decisions regarding the extent to which any cases should or should not be prioritized. Once again, the argument need not be that responses of this type are ideal, or even that they satisfy obligations or responsibilities that the United States may have separate from the Rome Statute to pursue criminal investigations or prosecutions, but rather that the existence of these steps are sufficient to warrant the Prosecutor not prioritizing these cases. The fact that so much of the Prosecutor’s information derives in the first place from the results of U.S. investigations, hearings, and reports might further bolster a decision not to pursue such cases given that doing so could be expected to disincentive states from undertaking similar non-criminal efforts in the future to bring past abuses to light.

There are further arguments that the Administration could consider related to other admissibility criteria. Most obviously, the United States could put forward an argument that, as compared with the innumerable international crimes committed by other armed groups in Afghanistan, the portion of the Afghanistan investigation that relates to the United States lacks sufficient gravity to warrant the Prosecutor prioritizing these allegations in her investigation. Such an approach would not diminish the seriousness of the allegations, but rather would aim to encourage that they be considered in relation to other alleged crimes and perpetrators within this and other situations. To be sure, under its jurisprudence and practice, Court actors generally look at “the situation as a whole” in determining whether the crimes in question are sufficiently grave to justify the Court’s involvement. There is no doubt that the scale of the crimes allegedly committed by the Taliban, Afghan security forces, and other armed actors are sufficient to satisfy the gravity test under the “situation as a whole” approach; as such, no separate inquiry would be required into the scale of the crimes allegedly committed by CIA personnel. The logic of the Court’s approach is not beyond debate, however. Even assuming this approach is maintained, however, the fact that the Prosecutor concludes that there is sufficient gravity to initiate an investigation into the situation as a whole does not necessarily mean that, as a matter of discretion, the Prosecutor should devote resources to actively pursuing allegations against a party to the conflict whose alleged conduct did not, if considered independently, meet the Court’s gravity threshold.

2. The Situation in Palestine

The Court’s efforts to investigate the situation in Palestine will also require attention. The Court’s recent conclusions, in a divided decision by a Pre-Trial Chamber, that Palestine is a state for purposes of the Rome Statute’s jurisdictional provisions, that there is jurisdiction over the situation in Palestine, and that jurisdiction extends to “Gaza and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem” are all inconsistent with the views of the United States under the Bush, Obama, and Trump Administrations. For its part, the Biden Administration has already put itself on record to the same effect, saying that it does “not believe the Palestinians qualify as a sovereign state, and therefore are not qualified to obtain membership as a state, or participate as a state in . . . the ICC.” In the wake of the decision, congressional support for the Israeli position has continued, including for example a statement from Senator Cardin calling the Court’s ruling “extremely disturbing” and a move that “undermines the path towards peace and erodes the Court’s credibility an impartial champion of justice,” and Senator Risch tweeting that, because it “unfairly targets Israel, ... the ICC’s reputation and credibility continue to deteriorate.”

Beyond this issue of the scope of the Court’s territorial jurisdiction, the Task Force notes that a number of other legal questions have been raised, including with regard to the circumstances in which transfers of population qualify as war crimes (particularly under customary international law) and the implications of the fact that both borders and settlements are treated by various international instruments—including General Assembly resolution 67/19, upon which the Court has relied in determining that it has jurisdiction—as “outstanding issues” to be resolved as part of a just, lasting, and comprehensive peace settlement between the Israelis and the Palestinians.

There are two important points to note about Israel’s concerns about the ICC. First, the matter of settlements is unique because Israel has taken the position that its settlements are permissible under international law. This category of allegations thus differs from others that might potentially be pursued against Israeli persons in light of complications this presents for challenging admissibility on the basis of complementarity. Second, Israel’s political cost/benefit analysis on the risks it faces with the ICC is different than that of the United States. For example, even if one puts aside the uncertain risk of an official actually being apprehended on a trip abroad, other states may become reluctant to receive Israeli officials because of the possibility of being asked to execute a warrant during an official visit.

It is of course beyond the mandate of this Task Force to make recommendations for pragmatic options for Israeli engagement, but the United States plainly has a keen interest in these issues. Insofar as the Israeli reaction to the Court’s decision is concerned, there have already been strong public statements by senior Israeli officials, including for example statements by Prime Minister Netanyahu saying that “\[w\]e will fight this perversion of justice with all our might.” At the same time, however, it appears that an important Israeli goal has been to work toward persuading the ICC Prosecutor to de-prioritize these cases. This would seem consistent with statements in press reports suggesting that Israeli officials do not in fact currently anticipate any immediate threats to senior Israeli political or military figures.

If working toward de-prioritization is in fact part of the Israeli strategy toward the Court, it would align with the general approach that the Task Force is recommending that the United States take with respect to the Afghanistan situation, and could thereby offer opportunities to proceed in ways that are mutually supportive. At the end of the day, the U.S. posture on the situation in Palestine will almost inevitably be more of a function of the direction of the Administration’s policy toward the Middle East peace process than of its ICC policy. Nevertheless, an approach based on prioritization would entail opportunities for the United States and Israel to work together constructively, of which the new Administration should avail itself.

3. Contributing to the Ongoing ICC Reform Process

Against the backdrop of its particular concerns about the ICC investigations in Afghanistan and Palestine, the United States should view the ongoing discussions about reform of the Court as an opening. Separate from questions about its relationship with the United States, a process of review and reform is underway involving the ICC and ASP. The ongoing discussions around the recently-completed Independent Expert Review provide an opportunity to propose and implement changes that could both put the Court on firmer footing—a goal that the current administration appears to have recognized as desirable by indicating support for reforms “to help the court better achieve its core mission of punishing and deterring atrocity crimes”—and to reduce the prospect of future clashes between the ICC and the United States. In short, these discussions present an opportunity to put forward credible arguments regarding how the various admissibility criteria should be interpreted and applied under the Rome Statute that differ from the way they have been applied until now, and to do so in a manner that echoes the reasons that the United States believes pursuing an investigation of CIA persons in Afghanistan would be inappropriate.

Numerous interlocutors from foreign states emphasized that they would welcome U.S. engagement in these discussions, both to benefit from the United States’ technical expertise and to incorporate its perspective. That said, they also cautioned that such engagement would be most effective if provided in a constructive manner and in the spirit of helping the Court to fulfil its core mandate, but that any engagement that was perceived as undermining, strongarming, or instrumentalizing the Court could backfire and make desirable reforms harder to achieve.

#### _a._ Work to Tighten the Court’s Admissibility Criteria

The IER report invites a conversation regarding ways in which the admissibility criteria could and should be applied more tightly. In particular, the Independent Experts identified the need for the Court to “focus on a narrower range of situations, and limit its interventions to the extent possible,” saying that the Court’s current approach “is unsustainable having regard to the limited resources” that the states parties make available to it in their annual decisions on the budget. Further, the IER report points to the need to resolve the different views between states parties, on the one hand, and the Prosecutor, on the other, as to the concrete expectations regarding what should be seen to be falling within the Court’s ambit. The Experts go on to highlight the need for “bringing all stakeholders on the same page on issues such as the type of cases the Court would look into.”

The pressure on the Prosecutor to find ways to better identify the situations and cases to which she should channel her finite energy and resources broke further to the fore in connection with the release of the Prosecutor’s latest report on Preliminary Examinations, in which the Prosecutor conveyed her conclusion that the standards for initiating an investigation in two countries—Nigeria and Ukraine—had been met but forewent actually commencing the investigation in view of “strategic and operational issues related to the prioritization of the Office’s workload.”

As an obvious example of a step in this direction, the Experts recommend that the Prosecutor consider a posture in which she would “investigate only those situations where alleged atrocity crimes reach a threshold of gravity higher than the current standard” and that she do so as part of a process of “allocating the limited resources of the OTP to the situations that are the most serious.” But there are other ways in which the Prosecutor could narrow her “aperture” in her decisions about which cases and situations to pursue. For example, separate and apart from the IER, there are ongoing, state-led discussions to take stock of, strengthen, and revise the principle of complementarity. States are exploring concrete options for how to assert greater oversight and ownership of this issue in their relations with the Court. This discussion is being conducted outside of the Assembly of States Parties itself, through a Working Group on Complementarity that makes it easier for non-party states such as the United States to engage. As such, a wide range of participants are providing input as states seek creative ideas on how to strike the appropriate balance on complementarity. The United States should contribute to this process and encourage states parties and the Court to re-imagine the approach to complementarity so that, without conceding that it would be legally precluded from doing so, the Prosecutor would as a matter of prosecutorial discretion deprioritize investigations and prosecutions in situations in which the relevant state or states had pursued non-criminal forms of accountability, undertaken substantial efforts to bring abuses to light, or undertaken measures to prevent recurrence. Such a response might be particularly appropriate with respect to non-member states that are under no obligations to cooperate with the Court or submit their domestic policies to ICC scrutiny. U.S. officials would need to think through carefully the manner in which they may want to bring their points forward. Much of this could be done in bilateral consultations or the many _ad hoc_ groupings in which U.S. government lawyers and global criminal justice experts routinely meet with counterparts.

#### b. Encourage Court Actors to Revitalize the Interests of Justice Inquiry

As another example, one might re-imagine the way that the OTP analyzes the “interests of justice” test in making decisions—whether under Article 53 on commencing an investigation or in connection with decisions thereafter regarding prioritization—in situations where societies have made decisions not to pursue criminal investigations that are reasonable under the circumstances even if, from the point of view of the ICC, less than ideal. For its part, the Office of the Prosecutor published a policy paper in 2007 that virtually eliminated the “interests of justice” test as a basis for a decision not to pursue a particular investigation. It is not at all clear that such an approach to the “interests of justice” test is in line with the understanding of the Rome Statute negotiators or best for the system as a whole. Thus, there appears to have been no meeting of the minds on whether it might be considered not to be in the interests of justice to pursue investigations and prosecutions in situations where—as in the then-recent case of the truth and reconciliation commissions in South Africa—a society had made a conscious decision to utilize alternatives to traditional modes of criminal accountability in order to come to terms with its past, such a truth-telling and reparations. Indeed, speaking in 1998, it seemed self-evident to then-Secretary-General Kofi Annan that “\[i\]t is inconceivable that, in such a case, the Court would seek to substitute its judgement for that of a whole nation which is seeking the best way to put a traumatic past behind it and build a better future.”

c. Moving the Court Away from the “Situation as a Whole” Principle

One of the most important possibilities for narrowing the aperture is related to the principle that the Prosecutor and the Court have applied that any investigation should be of the “situation as a whole.” The ICC Prosecutor has been clear on her view that, once an investigation is authorized, the authority to investigate applies to “the situation as a whole.” For example, when the Government of Uganda referred the situation “concerning the Lord’s Resistance Army” in northern Uganda to the ICC Prosecutor in 2003, the Prosecutor notified Uganda that the referral would be interpreted as covering “all crimes under the Statute committed in northern Uganda, and that \[its\] investigation would be impartial.” This approach was intended to prevent a sitting government from instrumentalizing OTP by empowering it to proceed only against the forces of the government’s adversaries and not those of the government.

While there is an undeniable logic to this principle, it is not the only defensible approach, particularly as it applies to _proprio motu_ investigations. Normally in _proprio motu_ situations, the Prosecutor must make a showing to persuade an ICC Pre-Trial Chamber that the jurisdictional requirements are met and that an evidentiary threshold has been reached. If the Prosecutor makes that showing with respect to the conduct of the forces of one of the parties, should the Prosecutor be authorized automatically to investigate the conduct of the other party’s forces, as to which no such showing has been made?

Indeed, a state may consider it fundamentally unfair that it could become subject to the burdens and possible political taint that often accompanies the commencement of a formal ICC investigation based solely on allegations about the conduct of an adversary. In the negotiations around the Rome Statute, at least some states relied on assurances that the treaty contained a built-in check that protected states from the risk of being subject to the burden of an investigation absent a conclusion that the standards set out in the Rome Statute had been met. The idea was that this would help protect states in situations where there was an insufficient basis to investigate the conduct of their personnel. At least arguably, the fact that a state can—under the “situation as a whole” principle—be enmeshed in an investigation based on the conduct of other parties erodes the value of such assurances. This issue is potentially important to the United States because, as the state with forces deployed in the largest number of states, the prospect of its forces being swept up in a “situation as a whole” is relatively high. In light of all this, the United States should look for opportunities to expand upon these arguments in its interactions with Court actors, ASP members and others.

#### d. Capture the Current Opening to Raise Issues of Concern

Each of the issues described in this section is important but also complex. On the one hand, a narrower “aperture” that results in the ICC pursuing a smaller range of situations and cases would in principle lessen the prospects for the ICC to end up confronting the United States in future cases. At the same time, because the United States retains a strong interest in accountability, deterrence, and atrocity prevention, diminishing the role that the ICC can play in support of these goals could come into tension with efforts to promote accountability in future cases. It is worth noting that, at least in the Bush and Obama administrations, the United States in key cases looked to the ICC Prosecutor for action and public statements to highlight the possibility of punishment by the ICC as a way to deter would-be perpetrators from committing further atrocities. The genocide in Darfur during the Bush Administration and widespread atrocities in the Central African Republic during the Obama Administration are two cases that come quickly to mind. Thus, while there undeniably are reasons that, as the Independent Experts recommend, the Court’s aperture should be narrowed, narrowing can come at great cost. Careful thought—and a hard-nosed assessment of both the pros and the cons—needs to be given to each of the possible ways in which such narrowing might occur. All that said, the broader point is clear: an atmosphere exists in which these issues can be put forward in a constructive manner and in which partner states can be expected to engage in a collegial and respectful manner.

Importantly, the audience for this kind of mature engagement is not solely the Court, but also the international community more generally and particularly our friends and allies in the ASP. The ongoing review and reform process has not, by its terms, involved the United States, but the United States needs to present itself as motivated to engage, wanting to provide leadership and good ideas, and having a stake in the Court’s objectives—around justice, deterrence, and norm enunciation—being achieved. Indeed, separate from whether the United States is successful in persuading friendly countries of its genuineness in this regard, there is a profound benefit simply in demonstrating that it is putting forth coherent arguments—that in itself is a show of respect to the sensibilities of U.S. friends and allies and the international order and a break from the past four years. The Biden Administration should approach its policy toward the Court with the same equanimity and respect that we expect it will approach multilateral institutions generally: it will seek to defend and advance U.S. interests, but will do so in ways that are principled, that advance the rule of law, and that reflect our core values.

#### e. Keeping Perspective

In all its interactions with the Court, and in the way it considers issues internally, the United States should eschew dogma and avoid making the perfect the enemy of the good. Perhaps most importantly, the United States should not exaggerate the threat that the Afghanistan investigation will actually lead to any trials of U.S. personnel. This is especially so in relation to allegations against Department of Defense personnel (for the reasons articulated above). In particular, the risk that a rank-and-file servicemember might be arrested on a European beach, invoked in some attacks on the Court, is _de minimis_. Nothing the ICC is doing in Afghanistan could plausibly lead to this result, and nothing the ICC has done in other cases suggests that this is a realistic scenario. Indeed, Former U.S. Legal Adviser John Bellinger has argued that in practical terms that “there is no possibility that any U.S. official will ever be arrested and prosecuted in the Hague. … \[T\]he likelihood of prosecutions is zero.”

#### f. Visions of “Success”

In practical terms, the United States needs to be open to different visions of success. Insofar as Afghanistan is concerned, and as stated above, the view of the Task Force is that the _actual_ risk of any American being tried is in fact remote. But even if the new Prosecutor concurs, it may nevertheless be harder politically for him to publicly offer an assurance to that effect, rather than to not pursue the investigations in a tangible way. Inaction can thus be a form of success, at least if such inaction becomes stable over time. The new Administration can increase the likelihood of success in this regard by taking steps that restore U.S. credibility more generally—_e.g_., engaging on issues in a constructive manner, communicating respectfully with Court personnel, defending itself “on the merits” and within the rule of law, speaking forthrightly about the Administration’s unrelenting opposition to torture, and disavowing the disdainful rhetoric that accompanied President Trump’s pardons for Eddie Gallagher and others. Indeed, these are policies that the United States should be adopting anyway, and are consistent with President Biden’s commitment that the United States will lead “by the power of our example.” All this will help create space for dialogue with Court actors and for U.S. friends and allies to give serious weight to U.S. views on these issues, thus adding to their credibility internationally.

To be sure, the sense that there is a risk—however remote—that the ICC might, with a sealed arrest warrant, ambush a current or former U.S. official while transiting through or visiting a Rome Statute country has tremendous potential for destabilizing any prospects for a constructive relationship. To address this issue, the United States, as part of its engagement with the new Prosecutor, should consider seeking a commitment that he will not seek a sealed arrest warrant against U.S. persons, at least without some subsequent notification that the Prosecutor has moved to a later stage and making clear that this commitment no longer applies.

## D. Support for Particular ICC Cases

The final question that this report will address is the extent to which the United States can and should support the ICC’s work in particular situation countries in light of the concerns generated by the Afghanistan and Palestine situations. In the past, the United States has provided a range of valuable (and often crucial) support to other international criminal tribunals—including diplomatic support for the institution and its activities, personnel and funding, and tangible assistance with specific investigations or cases. Indeed, the U.S. approach in the past (in particular the Obama Administration’s case-by-case approach) resulted in the provision of many comparable forms of support to the ICC at various points, including diplomatic support, _e.g._, in the U.N. Security Council and support for surrender and transfer of fugitives (see section XX above).

For its part, the new Administration has already indicated that—while the bulk of its energies with respect to the ICC would be spent on “defending our personnel”—there may be “exceptional cases where we consider cooperating with the court as we sometimes have in the past.” In practice, words like “case-by-case” and “exceptional circumstances” tend to be placeholders, the more precise content of which only becoming apparent only over time. In practice, despite the conflicting interests in potential investigations in Afghanistan and Palestine, there remain a number of ICC investigations and prosecutions that are directly aligned with concrete U.S. interests and policy positions (_e.g._, in Myanmar, Georgia, Ukraine, and Darfur). Likewise, there are cases underway in situations in which the United States has already made significant U.S. investments in accountability and stability (_e.g._, in Northern Uganda, DRC, and CAR).

The Task Force believes that the new Administration should remain open to supporting the ICC in appropriate cases, even as it recognizes that the political “space” for doing so will depend on wider circumstances, including most importantly the direction of ICC investigations or prosecutions in Afghanistan and Palestine. The Task Force recognizes the simple political truth that ongoing activity on these two situations would act as a headwind in this regard. It is also true, however, that the strength of that headwind will change as circumstances fluctuate over time, with the headwinds pushing more strongly against cooperation if those two investigations appear to move forward in ways that implicate U.S. personnel or provoke Israel, but relenting in the absence of such progress. At the same time, the likelihood of those headwinds—however strong they might be—abating may turn on events in particular atrocity situations, and conclusions about whether U.S. support for the ICC action will or will advance the range of important U.S. interests around international justice.

Indeed, this is the lesson of Darfur—even the Bush Administration’s acute concerns about the ICC eventually gave way to the overwhelming interest in standing up against a particular set of unfolding atrocities. Can the conclusion really be that President Bush should have blocked the Darfur referral to the Court in 2005? Or that the Obama Administration should have refused to work with the ICC when Bosco Ntaganda walked into the U.S. Embassy in Kigali, Rwanda, in 2013. Or that U.S. military forces should not have facilitated the surrender of Lord’s Resistance Army Commander Dominic Ongwen in 2015? It is inevitable that situations like these will arise again in which the imperatives of accountability for massive crimes will outweigh concerns with the ICC as an institution and that dogmatic opposition to the ICC in the face of mass atrocities may impose unacceptable costs on other U.S. interests.

The Task Force also recommends that the United States consider with fresh eyes how it will address questions of funding in the event of a future Security Council referral that it supports. The language included in the two previous Security Council referrals, and in the vetoed referral resolution on Syria, all contained language “recognizing” that none of the expenses would be borne by the United Nations. As described above this was a departure from what many drafters of the Rome Statute anticipated, and from what the U.S. delegation indicated “would be appropriate,” but was in line with the general U.S. approach to opposing the use of the UN budget to fund the expenses of independent organizations, and avoided legal concerns about whether the statutory restrictions on U.S. funding for the ICC would prohibit the United States from contributing its portion of the assessed UN budget that would be used for this purpose. In any event, there has been increasing opposition to the notion of further Security Council referrals for which the United Nations would not provide funding, with some states arguing that it is unfair to leave the Rome Statute parties bearing the costs for work that the Security Council wants it to carry out. Thus, assuming that a future case may well arise in which the United States wants to support a Security Council referral, there will very likely be significant pressure on the United States to reconsider its opposition to such funding and the United States should be prepared to consider creative ways to meet these concerns.

Finally, in connection with the general recommendation that the new Administration remain open to providing support for particular cases, it would be advisable for the new Administration to give thought in advance to categories of situations in which it would make sense to be alert to the possibility of providing assistance. Such categories where the case for United State support might be particularly strong might include situations referred to the Court by the Security Council (like Darfur itself) or that might be appropriate for a Council referral, situations in which a state has referred itself to the ICC (like the Central African Republic), situations involving particularly egregious or notorious perpetrators (like Myanmar or the LRA cases in northern Uganda), matters where the Obama administration was previously involved, and situations in which the alignment with U.S. political interests is particularly strong (as seen in the referral of the situation in Venezuela by Canada and five of our other Rio Treaty allies).

7. Conclusion

Any assessment of the Biden administration’s options for pragmatic engagement moving forward must take into account the experience of past engagements. In addition, decisions on whether and how to interact with the Court must also account for the reality that the United States’ role in the world—including as a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, a pillar of the global security architecture with a wide and valued network of alliances and military deployments, and an actor that is present in various ways in many ICC situation countries—means that there will be some circumstances in which engagement with the Court in some form or fora or another will be inevitable. As such, it will be necessary for the incoming administration to fine a “sweet spot” that is consistent with the need to both protect U.S. personnel for external jurisdiction while also projecting a renewed emphasis on working with friends and allies, international cooperation, acting “respectfully” even in the face of disagreements, positioning the United States to be an effective voice in multilateral diplomacy, and presenting the United States as motivated to engage, wanting to provide leadership, and having a stake in the Court’s objectives—around justice, deterrence, and norm enunciation—being achieved. In addition, the United States’ indelible commitment to advancing justice and accountability is one of our most treasured national attributes. The imperative of addressing the genocide in Darfur, notwithstanding U.S. hesitations around the Court, is a cogent reminder that the United States will want to act when crimes against humanity are underway, when civilians are targeted, and when a genocide is unfolding and sometimes the ICC will be the only option for justice.

The Report has thus endeavored to identify principles and recommend options that can guide this ongoing relationship with the Court, to allow policy makers to calibrate their engagement depending on the Court’s actions in Afghanistan and Palestine, and the progress of the current efforts towards reforming and refocusing the Court, and to enable officials to manage those unavoidable engagements with the ICC in a way that support, rather than conflicts with, affirmative U.S. interests in accountability and the rule of law.
