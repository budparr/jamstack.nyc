Talk 1: Jeff Escalante, HashiCorp (@jescalan)  
  
We all know that static websites work really well for small, simple pages, but what happens when your operation starts to grow? In this talk, we'll talk through a variety of architectural situations from my past, from personal websites to contract work to agency work to centralizing the web platform at a hypergrowth startup, and come to a conclusion on the most sustainable and painless way to architect web projects for each one.  
  
Jeff has been a jamstack advocate for many moons, having built two static site generators, roots and spike. He currently works as the web platform lead at HashiCorp
