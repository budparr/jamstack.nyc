This talk centers around making static sites work in the real world; from editing content (for non-technical users), to building and staging sites, to deployment and hosting, as well as user interaction. We'll review the landscape of tools and real-world use-cases.

Bud Parr is a front-end developer and designer who, for the past thirteen years, has worked with cultural and human rights organizations. He runs The New Dynamic, a site and meetup group devoted to static site generators, performance and the post-CMS paradigm.  

Jeremia Kimelman of the U.S. General Services Administration's 18F group talks about why and how they're enabling government agencies to publish static websites using existing tools along with their new open source Federalist platform.
