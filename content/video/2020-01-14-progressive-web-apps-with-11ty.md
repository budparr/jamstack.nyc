Talk 2: Jeff Posnick, Google (@jeffposnick)  
  
You can get all the Progressive Web "App" benefits, like instant, offline-first loading, without building a single-page app! This talk will be a architectural exploration of an example static site PWA, generated with 11ty: [https://jeffy.info](https://jeffy.info "https://jeffy.info")  
  
Jeff Posnick is a member of Google's Web Developer Relations, working on libraries and guidance around building PWAs.
