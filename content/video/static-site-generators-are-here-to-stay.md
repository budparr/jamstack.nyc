Phil Hawksworth has been building things on the web professionally for almost 20 years.

Between 2009 and 2018 that happened at agencies where he was fortunate to work with a wide range of public and private sector clients.

After 9 years working at agencies, Phil returned to working on a product. Now as part of the Developer Relations team at Netlify his focus is on developing strategies for using JAMstack technologies to make building for the web simpler, faster and more secure.
