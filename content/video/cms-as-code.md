In the "Cloud Age", systems are deployed using cloud services. Many of these services, including Contentful, provide friendly UIs where users can configure environments. Unfortunately, as the number of services that teams operate grows, it becomes unmanageable to maintain each one by pointing and clicking through the UI. "Infrastructure as Code" is an approach to deal with this issue: configuration of each service is automated, and the configuration is stored along with the source code for the application in version control. An API-first, headless CMS makes it possible to treat your CMS as code.
