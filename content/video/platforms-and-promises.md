description: "No matter how good you are at crafting the most ingenious, high-performance code, you need to deliver it to your users reliably. You probably also need to evolve it over time. To test it. To get it signed off. It can be painful. But it needn’t be.

This talk will look at ways to design a developer experience which then enables a good user experience.

We’ll talk about the benefits in keeping your stack simple, in using the expertise of others, and we’ll examine some performance and security benefits of the JAMstack and microservices."
