Introduction to Bodiless-JS, by Chris Oden  
  
Bodiless-JS is a new, open-source framework for building editable websites on the JAMstack, using React and Gatsby. This talk touches briefly on the journey from a monolithic D7 application to investigation of a leaner solution, which promises to ease many pains including workflow, sustainable customization, increased agility, and more.  
  
Then we dive into a hands on session on creating a new site built on Bodiless-JS.  
  
Chris has over 35 years as a software engineer. He worked in the research/technical space for many yars before moving into web development about 15 years ago. He worked extensively with Drupal 6 and 7 before escaping to the JAMstack world, where he led the design and development of Bodiless-JS. He is currently the Senior Technical Architect overseeing J&J Consumer Digital, responsible for platforms and tools to support hundreds of customer facing brand websites across the globe.
