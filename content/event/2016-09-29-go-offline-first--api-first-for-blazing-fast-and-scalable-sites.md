First talk: Jeremia Kimelman, of the GSA's 18F group, will show us how to make website content available offline and blazing fast, using service workers and his Jekyll plugin.

Jeff Escalante, of Carrot Creative will speak about how his firm uses API-driven static technology (#JAMstack), and introduceSpike.cf, the new static site generator his team is creating to be even more scalable and maintainable than Roots, their previous effort.

Thanks to our sponsor Civic Hall, the home for civic tech in New York City for providing us with meeting space.

Thanks to Fastly, the real-time content delivery network for providing us with food and beer.&nbsp;
