Ahead of our "Jekyll in the Newsroom" event Bud Parr will introduce static site generators like Jekyll, and explain why people have become so excited about them recently.

We'll go over why you should consider building your next site with these tools, covering, security, cost and other benefits, and review the ecosystem of tools.


This event is being held in conjunction with The New York Civic Tech Meetup.
