This month we'll start right off getting into the meat of site-building: Deciding how to structure our content, reviewing the most powerful Jekyll filters as well as some must-have plugins. We'll continue making a real-world site that you can then use as a basis for your sites and get site up on a web host.

If you want to follow along in code (you can also just listen in) you will already be able to run Jekyll on your machine, since we covered installation in our first session.

We will have a live/streaming option if you're not in NYC and would like to participate. RSVP and leave a comment if you want to participate remotely.
