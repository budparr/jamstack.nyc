## Serverless with AWS AppSync with Gatsby on the AWS Amplify Framework

Nader Dabit will show how to build custom JamStack APIs with GraphQL and serverless functions using Amplify & the Amplify CLI. We'll take a new Gatsby site, add a GraphQL backend, & then add serverless functions to dynamically fetch data. We'll also look at how to implement client-side authentication in a Gatsby site.

## Serverless with Vue.JS

With the rise of serverless architectures, developers have the power to do more with less. Rather than spending time and energy deploying and managing a server, they can now focus on the business logic driving their applications. We'll examine strategies for building applications in VueJS with a serverless mindset. Specifically, we'll walk through real life use cases of how we can bank on serverless functions to do the work of making API calls and communicating with third party services.

Nader Dabit is a web & mobile developer, author, Developer Advocate at Amazon Web Services.

Divya Sasidharan is a web developer who is passionate about open source and the web. She is currently a developer advocate at Netlify, and believes that there is a better workflow for building and deploying sites that doesn't require a serverâ€”ask her about the JAMstack. You will most likely find her in the sunniest spot in the room with a cup of tea in hand.

We'll start with some chatting and networking over food and drinks.

The event will be held at AWS Loft at 350 W. Broadway.
