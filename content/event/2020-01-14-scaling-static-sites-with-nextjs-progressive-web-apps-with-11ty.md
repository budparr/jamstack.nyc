Talk 1: Jeff Escalante, HashiCorp (@jescalan)

We all know that static websites work really well for small, simple pages, but what happens when your operation starts to grow? In this talk, we'll talk through a variety of architectural situations from my past, from personal websites to contract work to agency work to centralizing the web platform at a hypergrowth startup, and come to a conclusion on the most sustainable and painless way to architect web projects for each one.

Jeff has been a jamstack advocate for many moons, having built two static site generators, roots and spike. He currently works as the web platform lead at HashiCorp

Talk 2: Jeff Posnick, Google (@jeffposnick)

You can get all the Progressive Web "App" benefits, like instant, offline-first loading, without building a single-page app! This talk will be a architectural exploration of an example static site PWA, generated with 11ty: [https://jeffy.info](https://jeffy.info "https://jeffy.info")

Jeff Posnick is a member of Google's Web Developer Relations, working on libraries and guidance around building PWAs.
