On Monday, 10/29 I'll be giving a lightning talk at the [JAMstack.conf](https://jamstackconf.com/) in San Francisco.

My talk will be about Hugo. The talk is titled, appropriately, "Go Go Hugo" and here is the description:

> With hundreds of choices, why is Hugo—built in Go—one of the most popular tools in the JAMstack ecosystem? This talk will look at some of Hugo's super powers and less well known features to see how it can be used to great effect on any type of site, from the small to complex.

See you there!
